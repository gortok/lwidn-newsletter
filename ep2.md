### I see you, Jithub

Github, the eponymous source control collaboration system for Open Source Projects, has been caught trying to sneakily continue its contracts with ICE -- you know, the government agency that puts kids in cages -- by getting a contract award from ICE through Dell Federal Systems.

Now all of this may be on the up-and-up; Dell sells Github enterprise to ICE as a reseller, Github gets plausible deniability, and ICE gets to use the cool kids source control system.

But it's still morally bankrupt for Github to take this contract -- for an amount, I might add, that totals $79,312.50, or roughly the same amount Microsoft should have paid Keivan for using his AppGet architectural work in their WinGet package manager solution.

We see you, Github. Special thanks to [Dave Copeland](https://twitter.com/davetron5000/status/1282738504624222208?s=20) for making me aware of this. Twitter is sometimes a beautiful thing.

### Nick Craver talks Attacks on Stack Overflow.

Stack Overflow, the largest* (that gets press) site built on ASP.NET MVC (and soon .NET Core), gets a lot of attacks against as a top 40 site on the internet.  Nick Craver, their architectural lead; goes deep into the sorts of attacks that happen. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6NECAZhJG4 This is a good watch. Watch it.
