# .NET Bio

[.NET Bio](https://github.com/dotnetbio/bio) is an open source library of common bioinformatics functions, intended to simplify the creation of life science applications.

The core library implements a range of file parsers and formatters for common file types, connectors to commonly-used web services such as NCBI BLAST, and standard algorithms for the comparison and assembly of DNA, RNA and protein sequences. Sample tools and code snippets are also included.
