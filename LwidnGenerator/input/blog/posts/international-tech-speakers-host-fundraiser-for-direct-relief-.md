### .NET Foundation Presents 24-Hour Virtual Conference Streamed on Twitch and YouTube

Learn from incredible technology speakers during a 24-hour, worldwide fundraiser for Direct Relief's emergency fund for those affected by COVID-19. &nbsp;The fundraiser will take place on May 12th, 2020 and is hosted by the .NET Foundation. The virtual event will begin at 12:00 UTC May 12th, 2020 and consist of technology speakers scheduled to present for 24 hours, while raising funds for a cause.

Technologists, from all backgrounds, have gathered together with one singular goal in mind: To raise awareness and funds for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 related illness. Interactive collaboration and learning are the tools Dev Around The Sun organizers are using to accomplish their mission within the technology community. This is a cross-platform, polyglot event with high-level tech talks, as well as human skills talks.

"My initial thought was doing something similar to Live Aid, only for the developer community," said .NET Foundation Executive Director, Claire Novotny, "Using our skills and our network, this was something that the organizers and I felt would unite the global developer community to help support those suffering from the COVID-19 outbreak."

Regardless of who you are and what role technology plays in your life, Dev Around The Sun wants developers around the world to have the opportunity to take part in a very important cause during these times, while at the same time being part of a vast community of people with shared interests.

By collecting funds via sponsorship and match-donations, Dev Around The Sun will be able to give back to those affected by this crisis, with the hope that folks taking part in this event will be able contribute in any way they can.
