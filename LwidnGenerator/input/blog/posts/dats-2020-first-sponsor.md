Dev Around The Sun is bringing together technologists from all backgrounds and from around the globe, with two important goals in mind: to raise awareness and provide financial support for the many people fighting the current coronavirus and COVID-19 pandemic, while also delivering hope and reconnecting those in the global developer community.

This is a cross-platform, language-agnostic event, with high-level tech talks, as well as human skills talks. The public may sign up at https://DevAroundTheSun.org. Hear renowned speakers from a broad set of communities who will educate, entertain, and inspire an international audience in the comfort of their own homes. This is a 24-hour, worldwide fundraiser for Direct Relief's coronavirus emergency fund. The telethon-style fundraiser is hosted by the .NET Foundation. It begins at 12:00 UTC May 12th, 2020 and technology speakers are scheduled to present on Twitch and YouTube for 24 hours.

Sponsors of this event are World Wide Technology, Microsoft, Okta, Arana Software, and  others.

Conference organizers want to ensure that no matter who you are and what role technology plays in your life, everyone has the opportunity to take part in a very important cause during these times, while at the same time being part of a vast community of people with shared interests. Conference organizer, Heather Downing stated, "We've always been connected globally as developers. We are uniquely positioned to help because we already have been connected in our love of technology. Technologists coming together to raise funds for those devastated during the coronavirus pandemic is something we can do as a community. We can help, together as one tech industry from many programming languages and platforms."
