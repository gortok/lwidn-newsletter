The voting period for the 2020 .NET Foundation Directors election begins tomorrow at 12:00 PDT and runs through August 3 at 12:00 PDT. All members will receive an email link from [OpaVote](https://www.opavote.com/methods/single-transferable-vote) for your ballot; it's the same system we used last year.

There are an amazing slate of [candidates](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/election/candidates) running and it'll be a tough choice! Be sure to check out the [YouTube playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1rZQsJPBU2Qjz-agkBKHon6BRnqlsoPN) as it contains interviews with the candidates. Remember, the .NET Foundation is lead by the Board of Directors, and your choices determine what we will do this coming year; elections matter.

We are using a ranked choice voting system, so be sure to add all the candidates you want, in the order you prefer. When the voting period ends, it'll tally them all up. Results will be reported on August 4th.

Happy voting!
