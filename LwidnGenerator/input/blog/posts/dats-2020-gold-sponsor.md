 Dev Around The Sun organizers announce Quicken Loans as a Gold Sponsor for their conference May 12th. The virtual conference brings technologists together from all backgrounds; Dev Around The Sun â€” an online conference featuring a diverse group of technologists from all over the world. They will speak on a variety of topics, both high-level tech and human skills. Conference organizers created the event with two goals in mind: to raise awareness/provide financial support for the many people fighting the novel coronavirus pandemic, and deliver hope and reconnect the global developer community.

The event begins 12:00 UTC (5:00am PDT) May 12th, 2020. Speakers are scheduled to present for 24-hours. This global event aims to offer hope, raising awareness, and provide financial relief to people fighting the current global pandemic. Everyone is invited to attend for free. Tune-in to Twitch/YouTube. Sign up for updates at https://DevAroundTheSun.org.

"The two things that stuck out for me about this event were the mission; Part of our culture is 'doing the right thing' and anything we can do to contribute, I think there is value there," said Quicken Loans CIO, Brian Woodring. "Second, this is a great opportunity to engage our team and connect us to the global developer community. Especially at a time like this, when a lot of conferences are being canceled and training isn't available. A lot of the resources that people would normally use aren't available. I thought this would be a fantastic opportunity to give our team the chance to engage and rally."

Hear technologists from a broad set of communities, spanning many technologies and continents as they educate, entertain, and inspire our international audience in the comfort of their own homes. All proceeds go to Direct Relief's coronavirus fund. The fundraiser is hosted by the .NET Foundation.
