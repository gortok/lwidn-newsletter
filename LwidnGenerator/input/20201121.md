{{RELEASE}}{{BUG}}[Visual Studio 16.8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#--visual-studio-2019-version-1680) has been released; [and it might have uninstalled the .NET Core 3.1 SDKs on your behalf](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/status/1327251631642120193).  

{{DICE}}[Random Street View shows you a place in the world randomly](https://randomstreetview.com/).  Hopefully this gives you something fun to do during this holiday week while waiting for the clock to hit 5pm.

{{RELEASE}} [Do you like the idea of using C# for scriptiong?](https://www.strathweb.com/2020/11/dotnet-script-1-0-0-released-with-support-for-net-5-0-and-c-9/?_lrsc=680b8c9d-b1bd-43d5-8737-f201a37a80cd&utm_campaign=elevate&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social)  dotnet-script provides that.  Personally I'm of a mind that they should have modified C# for Scripting a long time ago and not invented Powershell, but we don't all get what we want.

{{STOP}} [Github reverses course and re-enables the youtube-dl repository](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1328365679473426432?s=20).  The RIAA had issued a takedown notice; since the youtube-dl repository allows for command line accesss to Youtube.  Initially Github caved (because they thought they had to?) and removed the repository; but [after the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) stepped in with a supporting letter as to why the RIAA was mistaken in their claim](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-16-RIAA-reversal-effletter.pdf), they re-enabled access to the repository.

{{BREAKING CHANGE}} [If you have a class with a private default constructor in .NET 5; SignalR can't deseralize it](https://weblogs.asp.net/rweigelt/tiny-difference-big-consequences-reloaded-signalr-in-net-core-3-1-vs-net-5).  The author of this blog post suffered so we wouldn't have to.

{{NOTES}} [AppVeyor has a helpful (short) blog post on Version pinning for .NET 5 and the .NET Core SDK](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2020/11/14/dotnet-5-and-dotnet-core-sdk-version-pinning/).

{{RELEASE}} [.NET Framework November 2020 Security and Quality Rollup Updates have been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-november-2020-security-and-quality-rollup-updates/). This is a release of the "Preview" I mentioned a few weeks ago;  although the word 'security' is in the title, there aren't any security updates in this release.

{{MEME}} [Jimmy Bogard released a galaxy brain meme on how to see if a string is null in C#](https://twitter.com/jbogard/status/1328005318249492483?s=20)  It's pretty extensive.

{{DOCS}} [You can see all the differences between the .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Core 3.1 APIs vs .NET 5 here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/pull/5610/files).  It's pretty cool to see all the API differences in one place.  

{{NOTES}} [Roadmap for WinUI 3 should be out in the first half of 2021](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1328756283860725760?s=20).  I've said this before and I'll say this again: I have no idea what WinUI is or how it's different from all the other UI strategies Microsoft has had; but maybe we'll get lucky and it'll finally unify everything.

{{RELEASE}} Along the same vein, [WinUI 3 Preview 3 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/).

{{BLOG}} [Julie Lerman shows you how to deploy containerized .NET 5 applications using AWS's fargate](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/deploying-dotnet-apps-to-containers).  Also maybe one day AWS will unify its containerization strategy.

{{VIDEO}} [Monsters weekly releases a video on how C# 9's Pattern Matching can make your job as a developer easier](https://aspnetmonsters.com/2020/11/monsters-weekly/ep191/).

{{VIDEO}} [There's a new Git Experience in Visual Studio 2019 16.8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHrAg3iKoe0&feature=youtu.be). If you use the UI; let me know how much better it's gotten.
