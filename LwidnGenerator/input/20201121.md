📢🐛[Visual Studio 16.8](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#--visual-studio-2019-version-1680) has been released; [and it might have uninstalled the .NET Core 3.1 SDKs on your behalf](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver/status/1327251631642120193).  

🎲[Random Street View shows you a place in the world randomly](https://randomstreetview.com/).  Hopefully this gives you something fun to do during this holiday week while waiting for the clock to hit 5pm.

📢 [Do you like the idea of using C# for scriptiong?](https://www.strathweb.com/2020/11/dotnet-script-1-0-0-released-with-support-for-net-5-0-and-c-9/?_lrsc=680b8c9d-b1bd-43d5-8737-f201a37a80cd&utm_campaign=elevate&utm_source=twitter&utm_medium=social)  dotnet-script provides that.  Personally I'm of a mind that they should have modified C# for Scripting a long time ago and not invented Powershell, but we don't all get what we want.

🛑 [Github reverses course and re-enables the youtube-dl repository](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1328365679473426432?s=20).  The RIAA had issued a takedown notice; since the youtube-dl repository allows for command line accesss to Youtube.  Initially Github caved (because they thought they had to?) and removed the repository; but [after the Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF) stepped in with a supporting letter as to why the RIAA was mistaken in their claim](https://github.com/github/dmca/blob/master/2020/11/2020-11-16-RIAA-reversal-effletter.pdf), they re-enabled access to the repository.

💔 [If you have a class with a private default constructor in .NET 5; SignalR can't deseralize it](https://weblogs.asp.net/rweigelt/tiny-difference-big-consequences-reloaded-signalr-in-net-core-3-1-vs-net-5).  The author of this blog post suffered so we wouldn't have to.

📝 [AppVeyor has a helpful (short) blog post on Version pinning for .NET 5 and the .NET Core SDK](https://www.appveyor.com/blog/2020/11/14/dotnet-5-and-dotnet-core-sdk-version-pinning/).

📢 [.NET Framework November 2020 Security and Quality Rollup Updates have been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-framework-november-2020-security-and-quality-rollup-updates/). This is a release of the "Preview" I mentioned a few weeks ago;  although the word 'security' is in the title, there aren't any security updates in this release.

{{MEME}} [Jimmy Bogard released a galaxy brain meme on how to see if a string is null in C#](https://twitter.com/jbogard/status/1328005318249492483?s=20)  It's pretty extensive.

📝 [You can see all the differences between the .NET Standard 2.1 and .NET Core 3.1 APIs vs .NET 5 here](https://github.com/dotnet/core/pull/5610/files).  It's pretty cool to see all the API differences in one place.  

📝 [Roadmap for WinUI 3 should be out in the first half of 2021](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1328756283860725760?s=20).  I've said this before and I'll say this again: I have no idea what WinUI is or how it's different from all the other UI strategies Microsoft has had; but maybe we'll get lucky and it'll finally unify everything.

📢 Along the same vein, [WinUI 3 Preview 3 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/winui/winui3/).

📝 [Julie Lerman shows you how to deploy containerized .NET 5 applications using AWS's fargate](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/deploying-dotnet-apps-to-containers).  Also maybe one day AWS will unify its containerization strategy.

🎥 [Monsters weekly releases a video on how C# 9's Pattern Matching can make your job as a developer easier](https://aspnetmonsters.com/2020/11/monsters-weekly/ep191/).

🎥 [There's a new Git Experience in Visual Studio 2019 16.8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UHrAg3iKoe0&feature=youtu.be). If you use the UI; let me know how much better it's gotten. 

💡 [Exception Filters allow you to pare down what you're catching](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1329107580648624129?s=20), and as the old adage goes, [if you can't handle it, don't catch it](https://stackoverflow.com/a/4540223/16587).

💡 [Microsoft edge allows you to add 'notes' to a PDF document](https://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2020/11/add-comment-to-pdf-in-microsoft-edge.html) Keep this up, Edge and I may install you on my PC.

📝 [Top 5 features of EF Core 5.0 from 4 Entity Framework Experts](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/11/17/ef-core-5.aspx).  While we're running the numbers, it turns out there were 240 enhancements, 380 bug fixes, and around 200 updates to documentation, and to give you an idea, EF Core 3.1 was released On 3 December 2019; so all those changes were made in the span of 11 months.

📝 [The Roslyn team wrote a blog post detailing what's new in the .NET Productivity Realm](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/whats-new-in-net-productivity/) If you use Visual Studio 2019, it's worth your time to check this out since you're likely to find *something* to help you out.

📝 [Joseph Guadagno shows you how to add .NET 5 support to the Azure App Service](https://www.josephguadagno.net/2020/11/17/adding-dotnet5-support-to-azure-app-service) I'm not sure why this is a thing we as developers have to do; but here we are.

📢 [Microsoft Research released a fuzzing tool for HTTP and REST APIs](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/restler-finds-security-and-reliability-bugs-through-automated-fuzzing/?OCID=msr_blog_restler_tw). A fuzzer is a real life incarnation of the saying "Throwing spagetti at a wall and see what sticks".  

📢 [TypeScript 4.1 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1/).  Here's my periodic reminder to you that TypeScript *does not respect SemVer* and therefore not pinning to the exact version of TypeScript you're using (major.minor.patch) is a good way to cause random build breakages whenever typescript releases a new version.

💡 [Don't use the TFM without the SDK, says .NET team](https://twitter.com/clairernovotny/status/1329472367781945344?s=20). Basically if your TFM is readable, you're not using the right thing.  Include both the TFM and the SDK number so you're pinned to the exact right thing.

📢 [Microsoft.Data.SqlClient 2.1 has been released](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/sql-server/released-general-availability-of-microsoft-data-sqlclient-2-1/ba-p/1913051) with lots of bug fixes and performance improvements -- and they mean it this time.

And lastly,

📝 [Explaining Chains, Funcs and Actions in C#](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/chain-lambdas-in-dotnet).  Honestly this all sounds a bit like a kink; but I assure you, it's all SFW.
