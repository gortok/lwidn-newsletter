Do you deserialize XML to a DataSet? (CVE-2020-1147)

More details on CVE-2020-1147 -- that Remote Code Execution Vulnerability for .NET Core. Turns out it has to do with deserializing XML into a DataSet. If this is something you do; stop reading and go patch.

Everyone else, [here's a bit more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/security-guidance) than I was able to get last week.

Special Thanks (again) to [@vcsjones](https://twitter.com/vcsjones) on twitter.


### Microsoft talks about Windows 10X

Apparently in Windows 10X, Win32 applications will be virtualized and served "over the cloud". OK https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-launch-windows-10x-web-first-os-without-legacy-win32-app-support


### Voting is now open for the .NET Foundation board of directors:

### .NET 5 Preview 7 has been released

https://github.com/dotnet/core/releases/tag/v5.0.0-preview.7

This includes changes to the runtime, SDK, ASP.NET Core, and Entity Framework Core.

For ASP.NET Core, the [changes focus around cookie bugs and blazor bugs](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A5.0.0-preview7+label%3ADone+label%3Abug+is%3Aclosed).

I may have blown the spoiler; but [Blazor is now a part of .NET 5](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/20519). There's more work to do, but [this is a great start](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/21514).

There's [a lot of fixes in Entity Framework Core 5.0.0 Preview 7](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=is%3Aissue+milestone%3A5.0.0-preview7+is%3Aclosed+label%3Atype-bug+is%3Aclosed)., too numerous to count.  If you use EF Core, you may want to pay attention.

### A 'replacement' for SecureString is being bandied about:

https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/147

SecureString, the oft-maligned and probably most misused class in .NET, is getting its hair re-did as "ShroudedString".  The name change is to help reiterate that this string isn't a "SecurityFeature", rather it's a signal that if you're trying to log stuff; YOU SHOULDN'T LOG THIS.

Personally I'd rather they use Static Analysis tools to tell us that, but I get why they'd want to have a new class.
