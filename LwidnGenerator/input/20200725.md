Do you deserialize XML to a DataSet? (CVE-2020-1147)

More details on CVE-2020-1147 -- that Remote Code Execution Vulnerability for .NET Core. Turns out it has to do with deserializing XML into a DataSet. If this is something you do; stop reading and go patch.

Everyone else, [here's a bit more information](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/data/adonet/dataset-datatable-dataview/security-guidance) than I was able to get last week.

### Microsoft talks about Windows 10X

Apparently in Windows 10X, Win32 applications will be virtualized and served "over the cloud". OK https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft-launch-windows-10x-web-first-os-without-legacy-win32-app-support
