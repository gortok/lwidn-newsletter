### [Microsoft Ignite was the 22nd - 24th of September and the news is here](https://news.microsoft.com/ignite-2020-book-of-news/) Lots of Azure, and lots of releases that large enterprises and governments would love. 

### [Top Ten APIs in .NET 5.0](https://blog.ndepend.com/top-10-net-5-0-new-apis/) Good info here, and lots you may not have known about.

### [How to build a Database application in Blazor Part 3](https://www.codeproject.com/Articles/5279963/Building-a-Database-Application-in-Blazor-Part-3-C)

Everything old is new again. Angular is the new Webforms, Blazor is the new Angular. Here we are, partying like it's 2009.

### [Visual Studio for Mac now supports iOS 14 and XCode 12](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/xamarin/ios-14-and-xcode-12-xamarin-ios/)

### [The magic phrase is redacted](https://twitter.com/Laughing_Mantis/status/1308212643723767809?s=20)

Apparently if you make that text in the above tweet your password you can find out if anyone stores your password in plain text.


### [Microsoft talks about what's new with the Windows SubSystem for Linux in September 2020](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/commandline/whats-new-in-the-windows-subsystem-for-linux-september-2020/).
  If we ever get to the year of Linux on the Desktop it will be through WSL.

### [Ginny Caughey talks about Project Reunion](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1308864047228555270?s=20)

I haven't quite figured out [what they want it to do](https://github.com/microsoft/ProjectReunion) but as long as it's "Simplify the sheer number of ways you can develop for Windows", I'm in.

### [Microsoft releases Microsoft.Data.Sqlite 5.0 RC1](https://www.bricelam.net/2020/09/23/microsoft-data-sqlite-5-0.html) for Entity Framework Core.

### [Jetbrains Resharper 2020.3 EAP is out](https://twitter.com/resharper/status/1309126457965379590), with support for C# 9 features like top-level statements.

### [The Desktop community Standup happened on September 24th, and this hour long standup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LT8ntgw8b3c&feature=youtu.be) dives into winforms and OSS.  In case it isn't apparent, Microsoft uses the word 'standup' loosely. 

### [Microsoft's Channel 9 goes into Microsoft Identity and how to get started with it](https://channel9.msdn.com/Shows/On-NET/Microsoft-Identity-and-series-introduction?utm_content=139667888&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-4083531 in this 15 minute video.

Fifteen minutes.  About the time a Standup should take...

### [Matthew Leibowitz writes a deep dive into System.CommandLine](https://dotnetdevaddict.co.za/2020/09/25/getting-started-with-system-commandline/).  

If you want to write a command line app in .NET, check out System.CommandLine. Finally there's a way to deal with parsing command line arguments that doesn't involve reinventing the wheel or using a go-clone library.

### [Nat Friedman, CEO of Github, unfollows everyone in an attempt to hear less about Github putting children in cages](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1309251778823692288).

On September 24th, Nat tweeted "Github Stories ðŸ¤”" and his replies filled up with references to ICE putting kids in cages.

If you remember, Github has a contract with ICE, and come hell, highwater, or angry public sentiment, is going to continue to honor that contract. Maybe Nat doesn't want hearing about that in his feed any more [and so he unfollowed everyone](https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1307412289620865026?s=20).

Some days twitter seems like high school, if the cliques in high school resulted in life and death decisions.

### [A paper entitled "How to build good software" dives through the common problems we run into developing software and how to fix them.](https://www.csc.gov.sg/articles/how-to-build-good-software)  

You can be forgiven for wanting to print this out and send it to every manager you ever had.


### [Hillel Wayne talks about the eternal debate: Is software craftsmanship?](https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1310309162811875332) 

(Spoiler: Maybe?)

He goes into the math problem of two people digging a hole and I don't think there's *anything* more closely aligned with programming than randomly digging holes.


### [Linux won't get any love in MAUI](https://twitter.com/gylkag/status/1310524861656313857?s=20)

MAUI is 'multi-platform', not 'cross-platform'.  While this may seem like tomato and tomato, there are a few people out there who are mad that MAUI won't support... the linux desktop.  Presumably the same number of people liked the ending of LOST.

If you are looking for 'true' cross-platform Desktop UI frameworks; give [AvaloniaUI](https://avaloniaui.net/) a try or give in and use electron like everyone else.

### [Microservices and Containerization Meetup tomorrow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_I8n8JPa_nQ)

The .NET Foundation is hosting the aforementioned meetup about Microservices and containerization tomorrow (September 29th) at 4pm UTC.

Remember: If someone touts microservices without diving into discussing communication among containers (past HTTP Request/Response), event-driven architecture, under what conditions your org structure would benefit from microservices, or whether or not your workload needs that sort of separation, run quickly.
