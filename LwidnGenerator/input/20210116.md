This is Last Week in .NET for the week that ended... well.. last week. It was a rocky week last week; and more of the same expected this week for the Washington DC area, and with an inaguration and Martin Luther King day at hand, let's dive into what happened last week in the world of .NET.

### Releases

[.NET 5.0.2 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0.2/5.0.2.md).  This release fixes [CVE-2021-1723 | ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1723) attack. If you run .NET Core on Kestrel, you're vulnerable to this attack, so update immediately. There are several bug fixes for [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved), the [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved), and [Entity Framework Core 5](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved) included as well.

In the same vein, [.NET Core 3.1.11 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1.11/3.1.11.md) with the same CVE 2021-1723 fix, as well as some backported fixes from .NET 5.0.2 and other fixes specific to .NET Core 3.1.

Not to be left out, [.NET Core 2.1.24 has also been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1.24/2.1.24.md) and at this point you can probably guess what I'm going to say: They fixed the aforementioned CVE vulnerability, as well as several backported bug fixes and bug fixes specific to .NET Core 2.1.

Speaking of .NET Core 2.1: Its End of Life is August 21, 2021](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-january-2021/)  As stated in the blog post, 
 > After that time, .NET Core 2.1 patch updates will no longer be provided. We recommend that you move any .NET Core 2.1 applications and environments to .NET Core 3.1 in first half of 2021. Itâ€™ll be an easy upgrade in most cases.

Parenthetically, of course, I hope your upgrades go better than mine usually do. I seem to hit every upgrade problem that could exist.  

### Other .NET News

[Mobilize.NET can convert your VB and VB.NET Apps to.NET Core](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/08/28/vb-to-core.aspx?utm_content=151002694&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-4083531) This seems like a neat little utility, and while there's a company behind it, if you have a VB or VB.NET application, this may be your ticket to making the migration to .NET Core (and .NET 5). Check it out and let me know how it performs for you. (special thanks to Dee Dee Walsh ([@ddskier](https://twitter.com/ddskier) on twitter) for the link.

[Mana Pichova shares networking improvements made in .NET 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-5-new-networking-improvements/) this is a great read but is definitely on the heavier side.  If networking is your jam, give this post a read.

[Jimmy Bogard talks about ActivitySource and Listener in .NET 5](https://jimmybogard.com/activitysource-and-listener-in-net-5/). These classes are replacements for DiagnosticSource and Listener, so if you use either of those, give this post a read.

[The Parler 'hack' is a masterclass in bad ideas having bad outcomes](https://twitter.com/venikunche/status/1348607851556712448?s=20) If you haven't kept up: Parler relied on several external services for security; but when those services were yanked away (due to Parler hosting neo-nazi and insurrectionist content), their code took the absence of such services as a reason to *approve* whatever action the user was trying to take.  It's the equivalent of your house security system letting everyone in if the phone-line goes down.  There's so much more to the Parler hack, from the lack of rate-limiting to the ability for people to pull down 60-70TBs of information from Parler's AWS hosted storage, which --- to add insult to injury, results in a massive egress bill from AWS to Parler, on top of AWS no longer hosting Parler.
