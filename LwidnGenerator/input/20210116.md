This is Last Week in .NET for the week that ended... well.. last week. It was a rocky week last week; and more of the same expected this week for the Washington DC area, and with an inaguration and Martin Luther King day at hand, let's dive into what happened last week in the world of .NET.

### Releases

[.NET 5.0.2 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0.2/5.0.2.md).  This release fixes [CVE-2021-1723 | ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1723) attack. If you run .NET Core on Kestrel, you're vulnerable to this attack, so update immediately. There are several bug fixes for [ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved), the [.NET runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved), and [Entity Framework Core 5](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved) included as well.

In the same vein, [.NET Core 3.1.11 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1.11/3.1.11.md) with the same CVE 2021-1723 fix, as well as some backported fixes from .NET 5.0.2 and other fixes specific to .NET Core 3.1.

Not to be left out, [.NET Core 2.1.24 has also been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1.24/2.1.24.md) and at this point you can probably guess what I'm going to say: They fixed the aforementioned CVE vulnerability, as well as several backported bug fixes and bug fixes specific to .NET Core 2.1.

Speaking of .NET Core 2.1: Its End of Life is August 21, 2021](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-january-2021/)  As stated in the blog post, 
 > After that time, .NET Core 2.1 patch updates will no longer be provided. We recommend that you move any .NET Core 2.1 applications and environments to .NET Core 3.1 in first half of 2021. It’ll be an easy upgrade in most cases.

Parenthetically, of course, I hope your upgrades go better than mine usually do. I seem to hit every upgrade problem that could exist.  

[Windows 10 version 20H2 Build 19042.746 has been released to the beta channels](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/01/12/releasing-windows-10-build-19042-746-20h2-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/) and these are chock full of security fixes that probably don't matter to you and I, but matter greatly to enterprises.

[The EF Core team releases a video discussing what's coming in EF Core 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IiAS61uVDqE&feature=youtu.be) They used the survey to help guide their thoughts for EF Core 6; and while I have a personal disdain for survey-driven-development, I understand why they'd want to do it.  There's also [a github issue related to EF Core 6 in case watching videos to get information is not your jam](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/23870)

[Mobilize.NET can convert your VB and VB.NET Apps to.NET Core](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2020/08/28/vb-to-core.aspx?utm_content=151002694&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-4083531) This seems like a neat little utility, and while there's a company behind it, if you have a VB or VB.NET application, this may be your ticket to making the migration to .NET Core (and .NET 5). Check it out and let me know how it performs for you. (special thanks to Dee Dee Walsh ([@ddskier](https://twitter.com/ddskier) on twitter) for the link.

[Jimmy Bogard talks about ActivitySource and Listener in .NET 5](https://jimmybogard.com/activitysource-and-listener-in-net-5/). These classes are replacements for DiagnosticSource and Listener, so if you use either of those, give this post a read.

[ZeroSharp - a way to compile C# to native code, has hit 1000 stars on Github](https://github.com/MichalStrehovsky/zerosharp) this is a wonderful milestone, and while github stars don't pay the bills, it's nice to see a .NET library hit wide usage.

[The analysis of the Solarwinds Hack digs deeper, this time into replacing MSBuild](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/sunspot-malware-technical-analysis/). SUNSPOT was another malware vector in the Solarwinds hack, and this article goes deep into how it was used to replace MSBuild.  This thing gets scarier and scarier.

[Speaking of scarier and scarier, nuget packages can run arbitrary code on your system](https://github.com/augustoproiete/i-am-root-nuget-package), and now I'm going to lie in my bathtub and rock gently, and that fantasy of buying a mountain cabin and living off the grid grows a step closer to reality.

[Jetbrains is hosting an AMA on January 21st, 2021 on Reddit](https://twitter.com/resharper/status/1348967244416618499?s=20) and you'll now have the opportunity to ask them how it feels to have Microsoft nipping at their heels for 21 years straight.

[Microsoft is close to running all its own services on Azure](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-moves-closer-to-running-all-of-its-own-services-on-azure/). Not running your own services on your own cloud is generally a bad signal to send to the world when you want them to trust your cloud, and kudos to Microsoft to fixing this glaring issue.

[The Parler 'hack' is a masterclass in bad ideas having bad outcomes](https://twitter.com/venikunche/status/1348607851556712448?s=20) If you haven't kept up: Parler relied on several external services for security; but when those services were yanked away (due to Parler hosting neo-nazi and insurrectionist content), their code took the absence of such services as a reason to *approve* whatever action the user was trying to take.  It's the equivalent of your house security system letting everyone in if the phone-line goes down.  There's so much more to the Parler hack, from the lack of rate-limiting to the ability for people to pull down 60-70TBs of information from Parler's AWS hosted storage, which --- to add insult to injury, results in a massive egress bill from AWS to Parler, on top of AWS no longer hosting Parler.

In the Things to make you feel good department](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/six-famous-artists-quotes-that-apply-to-programming) Khalid Abuhakmeh shares six quotes from artists that apply to programming. We could all use some good news right now.

[Scott Hanselman interviews Amanda Silver about an entire division going remote during the pandemic](https://hanselminutes.com/770/living-through-2020-as-a-remote-developer-with-amanda-silver)  When we said "The future of work is remote", I'm not sure we were counting on a pandemic being the catalyst.

[Github fired and then re-hired the person who made an internal team chat that said "Nazis are about" in the Capitol Insurrection](https://twitter.com/businessinsider/status/1349066876324896773) This disgusted me when it happened: A Jewish github employee was *fired* for warning the company about literal nazis.  The head of HR later fell on their sword for this egregious failure of leadership by the company, and it reinforces my question: Where the hell is the adult leadership at Github? Between the ICE contract and this, I'm not sure they realize what political sphere their company inhabits.
