### .NET Core 3.1.7 has been released 

[Release Notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-august-2020/)

The big news here is another major CVE has been patched, this time against ASP.NET Core.  [CVE-2020-1597](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1597) which is a Denial of Service vulnerability that targets how ASP.NET handles unauthenticated web requests.

In typical CVE fashion there isn't a released proof of concept; so while it's unknown if there are any exploits in the wild, you should upgrade and patch your ASP.NET Core installations immediately.

Also released in .NET Core 3.1.7 is a change to how .NET Core applications are built; ASP.NET Core applications [no longer generate a dylib on Mac, rather they generate a DLL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos-notarization-issues); this is due to the new notarization requirements starting in Mac OS Catalina.

If you're running an Ubuntu image based on version 19.10; be advised that it has now fallen out of support for .NET Core.  It's a brave new world folks where Microsoft takes a hatchet to OSes older than a year.  Keep in mind Windows 7 just fell out of support, so you know what side their bread is buttered on.

Also included is a new .NET Core SDK update: [3.1.107](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1.7/3.1.7.md#changes-in-317)

### .NET Core 2.1.21 has been released

This is also a release that fixes the CVE for .NET Core 2.1; [which is Microsoft's LTS supported version of .NET Core 2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)

Also if anyone is wondering whether your release cycle is complicated, the Visual Studio team is supporting no less than three different versions of VS 2019 version 16.x in production.
