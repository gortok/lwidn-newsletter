### .NET Core 3.1.7 has been released 

[Release Notes](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-core-august-2020/)

The big news here is another major CVE has been patched, this time against ASP.NET Core.  [CVE-2020-1597](https://portal.msrc.microsoft.com/en-us/security-guidance/advisory/CVE-2020-1597) which is a Denial of Service vulnerability that targets how ASP.NET handles unauthenticated web requests.

In typical CVE fashion there isn't a released proof of concept; so while it's unknown if there are any exploits in the wild, you should upgrade and patch your ASP.NET Core installations immediately.

Also released in .NET Core 3.1.7 is a change to how .NET Core applications are built; ASP.NET Core applications [no longer generate a dylib on Mac, rather they generate a DLL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/install/macos-notarization-issues); this is due to the new notarization requirements starting in Mac OS Catalina.

If you're running an Ubuntu image based on version 19.10; be advised that it has now fallen out of support for .NET Core.  It's a brave new world folks where Microsoft takes a hatchet to OSes older than a year.  Keep in mind Windows 7 just fell out of support, so you know what side their bread is buttered on.

Also included is a new .NET Core SDK update: [3.1.107](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1.7/3.1.7.md#changes-in-317)

### .NET Core 2.1.21 has been released

This is also a release that fixes the CVE for .NET Core 2.1; [which is Microsoft's LTS supported version of .NET Core 2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy/dotnet-core)

### Visual Studio 16.7.1 has been released;

Besides some IDE bugs fixed; the big news here is this also is listed as a product to update under CVE-2020-1597.

### Visual Studio 2017 15.9.26 has been released:

[Same for the CVE-2020-1597](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes#15.9.26).

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releasenotes/vs2017-relnotes

Also if anyone is wondering whether your release cycle is complicated, the Visual Studio team is supporting no less than three different versions of VS 2019 version 16.x in production. [16.0.17](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-v16.0#16.0.17), [16.4.12](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-v16.4), and [16.7.1](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes).

Please reach out to someone at the Visual Studio team and ask them if they're feeling ok.

Cecil Phillip sat down with David Glick to talk about Statiq; a static site generation framework for .NET Core.  I'm just getting into statiq (I want to use it to host the web version of these newsletters and make the generation process less... manual) and this is a great video to watch if you want to learn about Statiq.

### Microsoft ranks #3 on OSS contributions:

I will give microsoft credit here:  10 years ago they were *nobody* in the world of Open Source software. Literally not even on the radar. 

That said, I've got some problems with this ranking.  YOu know the guy on youtube that sits in the forest and builds a house from first principles? It's pretty neat.  Anyway, Microsoft is that guy, github is youtube, and we're the people who can watch but can't really force him to build a castle from first principles.  Although there's a youtube channel for that too. Anyway,  we're spectators. Microsoft pays the salaries of the .NET Maintainers (all of whom are Microsoft employees), and the .NET foundation's Executive director (And treasurer), are Microsoft employees.  This isn't altruistic code contribution to OSS, this is "Watch us build our products in the open".
