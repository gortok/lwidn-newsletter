### Last Week in .NET - Week Ending 29 May 2021

Build me up Buttercup

So Build happened last week.

[.NET 6 Preview 4 is out](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/preview/6.0.0-preview.4.md) and contains a metric ton of bug fixes and new docker images for your testing pleasure. Seriously, far too many to list here. Thankfully though [Microsoft has a blog post out detailing what's in it](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-4/).  I'll talk about some of these updates independently.

In .NET 6 Preview 4, [there's now a "Date Only" and "Time Only" struct which does what it says on the tin](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/49036).  This greatly simplifies my own code that tries to handle 'date only' and 'time only', so I'm prettty happy this is here.

[Announcing Maui Preview 4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-maui-preview-4/) which I can only assume was released with .NET 6 Preview 4, because otherwise there'd be two things named Preview 4 that track different releases and no self-respecting company would do that... right? RIGHT?

[Visual Studio 16.10 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#16.10.0) and appropos of nothing Visual Studio has multiple version numbers for a given 'year' version. 16.10 adds new productivity enhancements, Docker and git features.  Of note is that they've finally added a "Remove Unused references" command, which assumes parity with ReSharper from 2016.
