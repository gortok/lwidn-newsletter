### Last Week in .NET - Week Ending 29 May 2021

Build me up Buttercup

So Build happened last week.

[.NET 6 Preview 4 is out](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/preview/6.0.0-preview.4.md) and contains a metric ton of bug fixes and new docker images for your testing pleasure. Seriously, far too many to list here. Thankfully though [Microsoft has a blog post out detailing what's in it](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-4/).  I'll talk about some of these updates independently.

In .NET 6 Preview 4, [there's now a "Date Only" and "Time Only" struct which does what it says on the tin](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/49036).  This greatly simplifies my own code that tries to handle 'date only' and 'time only', so I'm prettty happy this is here.

[Announcing Maui Preview 4](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-maui-preview-4/) which I can only assume was released with .NET 6 Preview 4, because otherwise there'd be two things named Preview 4 that track different releases and no self-respecting company would do that... right? RIGHT?

[Visual Studio 16.10 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#16.10.0) and appropos of nothing Visual Studio has multiple version numbers for a given 'year' version. 16.10 adds new productivity enhancements, Docker and git features.  Of note is that they've finally added a "Remove Unused references" command, which assumes parity with ReSharper from 2016.

[Ginny Caughey shows you how to write platform specific code for MAUI](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1397262990550962189?s=20) and GIFs as teaching tool are magic. 

A video from Build titled [.NET 6 Deep Dive; what's new and what's coming](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/sessions/70d379f4-1173-4941-b389-8796152ec7b8?source=%2Ffavorites) is the headline, and I categorically refuse to make the easy joke about the headline.  If the punchline doesn't pop in your head, bless you.

[Azure Application Service feature list, in a tweet](https://twitter.com/sinclairinat0r/status/1397233099617021952); special thanks to Jeremy Sinclair ([@sinclairinat0r](https://twitter.com/sinclairinat0r) ) for the screen grab.

[Microsoft and Qualcomm team up to create a Windows on Arm64 Developer PC](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/25/22452710/microsoft-qualcomm-windows-on-arm-dev-kit-pc-features-release-date) So microsoft is releasing a PC that is lower priced than their Surface X ($999) to encourage development on Windows.  I say this as I am typing this up on a Mac, possibly the most expensive development machine ever to hit mass market usage.  On a lighter note, you could think of it as a Windows Mini machine. 

[The Windows Procmon tool has been reimagined for Linux](https://github.com/Sysinternals/ProcMon-for-Linux) What has the world come to that we can credibly say Microsoft is trying to provide a good Linux experience?

What do you mean George? Well [Microsoft support for Linux GUI apps on Windows 10 coming later this year](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-makes-support-for-linux-gui-apps-on-windows-10-generally-available/).  I'm not sure if this is a tacit admission that Microsoft lost the hearts and minds of developers or an admission that Linux lost the desktop war?

In news that will only shock managers, [Developers days are interrupted by meetings, a Github Study finds](https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/25/developers_interruptions_github/).  They interviewed developers and found out when and how they were most
