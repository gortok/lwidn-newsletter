### Last Week in .NET - Week ending 4/3/2021

💣 [Jesse Liberty started off the week with violence by introducing his team's updated coding standards for C#](http://jesseliberty.com/2021/03/02/c-coding-standards-updated/).  For the most part I agree with these standards, but there are a few I have problems with... which I suppose was the goal all along.

✒[Do you author Markdown files in VS Code?](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige/status/1376030529552846851?s=20) If so Paige Bailey ([@DynamicWebPaige](https://twitter.com/DynamicWebPaige) on twitter) has an amazing extension you should try. This extension made for markdown authors includes linting, spellchecking, image compression + resizing, templates, and *so much more*.  So much more is doing some lifting in that sentence. You should really check it out.

🤡 Can we just take a moment and [admire the absurdity that are cookie popups on the modern web?](https://twitter.com/5tevieM/status/1375116382770171906?s=20)  Government makes, what is at its core, a pretty sensible law, and in true governmental fashion the implementation looks like a 5 year old describing a platypus.  

🤿[Nick Dives deep into Project Reunion and its versioning](https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/project-reunion-versioning/). If you do desktop development for Windows, you're going to want to read this.  This blog post is the simplest explanation I've seen yet of "Project Reunion" and all the ins and outs that trying to "reunite" the APIs entails.

💁‍♂️[Scott Hanselman teaches you how to launch Windows terminal for all your shell needs](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1375562131060363266?s=20).  Want to have the command prompt launch Windows Terminal? How about Powershell launching in Windows Terminal?  This hack can help you do that.

⚖[Microsoft registers its 'concern' with the Atlanta Election Law](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2021/03/31/why-we-are-concerned-about-georgias-new-election-law/). They registered 'concern' in the same way my spouse registers concern when I have a second piece of cake.  In the same way, it's not going to make the Republicans rethink their actions, it'll just make them not brag about it as much.

🍾[Visual Studio Code v1.55 has been released](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_55) Lots of little updates and customizations in this one because if there's one thing programmers love, it's customizing their IDEs.

🐛[Nuget has about 80 weeks to fix a bug with how it stores its download counts](https://github.com/NuGet/NuGetGallery/issues/8476).  Newtonsoft.Json gets 12 million downloads a week(!) and in about 80 weeks it will overflow the int32 storage defined in Nuget's download count.  It is out of sheer schadenfreude that I'll point out System.Text.Json (NSJson's replacement) gets around 267,000 downloads a week.  

🟦[Public preview: Azure Static Web Apps now supports deployment with Azure DevOps](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/public-preview-azure-static-web-apps-now-supports-deployment-with-azure-devops/).  Azure can mean on prem or in the cloud because I've come to conclude Microsoft's teams OKRs require them to adopt the word "Azure" for everything. Enjoy that thought.

🔐[There's a POC for the Windows Console Driver Vulnerability](https://github.com/waleedassar/CVE-2021-24098). [CVE-2021-24098  has been patched](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2021-24098), and if you haven't patched your systems, the usual disclaimer applies: You should.

😜[There's a new insight into the old Microsoft Coffee april fool's prank](https://microsoft-coffee.medium.com/microsoft-coffee-25545836a7e3). If you remember this one, enjoy this blog post about how it all started.

🚧[Azure Portal and Azure services went down last week]([https://twitter.com/TheRegister/status/1377752189322502147?s=20), and to no one's surprise the cause was DNS.

📆[Microsoft Build is virtual and is happening May 25-27, 2021](https://twitter.com/DonovanBrown/status/1377739812770353157).

👮‍♀️[.NET 6 will have W^X enabled for all architectures](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/50391) W^X is _write xor execute_ and it provides that memory is either writable or executable, but not both. It's a lot of work, but will make .NET better when it's done.

🤚[TypeScript 4.3 has a neat addition for imports](https://twitter.com/orta/status/1375379452293697539) it will now auto-complete the import for you.
