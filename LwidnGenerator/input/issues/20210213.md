## Last Week in .NET - February 13th, 2021


{{ ALERT ALERT ALERT }} Microsoft releases a whitepaper on mitigating risk when using Private package feeds.  This dovetails [with the security researcher who wrote about how they hijack'd namespaces for private feeds](https://twitter.com/alxbrsn/status/1359200840876257287?s=20); and Microsoft releases a whitepaper on this issue and how to mitigate this. This is up top because it's crucially important for teams that use private Nuget feeds.  

[Microsoft releases a whitepaper on mitigating risk when using Private package feeds]https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/().  Last week I wrote about how an attacker can hijack namespaces for private feeds; and Microsoft releases a whitepaper on this issue and how to mitigate this. This is up top because it's crucially important for teams that use private Nuget feeds. [Thanks to Barry "I love Beans" Dorrans for sharing this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/blowdart/status/1359205016016326657).  

If you use Azure Artifacts to store your private packages, [Microsoft has done you a solid](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/devops/changes-to-azure-artifact-upstream-behavior/) and fixed that behavior as well.

### Releases

{{ ALERT ALERT ALERT }} Several CVEs have been fixed with new .NET Core updates, including [CVE-2021-1721](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/175) (Denial of Service) and [CVE-2021-24112](https://github.com/dotnet/announcements/issues/176) (Remote Code Execution).

{{CHAMPAGNE}} [Visual Studio Code v1.53 has been released](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_53). You can now wrap tabs instead of horizontally scrolling when you have a lot of tabs open.  I feel seen.

{{BIRTHDAY CAKE}} [Cake v1.0.0 has been released](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2021/02/cake-v1.0.0-released). It's been 112 releases to 1.0, and congrats to Cake for getting there.  For those of you just hearing about Cake, it's a C# build engine in the style of Make, from where it gets its name.

{{ ALERT}} [.NET 5.0.3 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0.3/5.0.3.md) this fixes the aforementioned CVEs and bug fixes for 
[ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved), [Entity Framework Core](https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved), [the runtime](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved), and even [Winforms](https://github.com/dotnet/winforms/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.3+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved).


{{ ALERT}} [.NET Core 3.1.12 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1.12/3.1.12.md) with the same CVE fixes but far fewer bug fixes for the Runtime, the CoreCLR, Winforms, and ASP.NET Core.


{{ ALERT}} [.NET Core 2.1.25 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/releases/tag/v2.1.25) and you get the aforementioned CVE fixes [but only one lone fix for ASP.NET Core](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/pull/28908). 


### .NET Events

{{VIDEO}} [Scott Hunter, Director of Program Management for .NET, is giving a talk on the state of .NET 5 and what's coming in .NET 6](https://www.meetup.com/nopCommerce-Global-Meetup/events/275569812/?utm_content=153082719&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2384354214). It's an MS Teams event but let's not hold that against Scott. .NET 6 has big shoes to fill: It's the first LTS release under the ".NET" moniker; and it's when MAUI is due.  Special thanks to Ginny Caughey ([@gcaughey](https://twitter.com/gcaughey) on Twitter) for the link.

[The Event List for .NET Conf Focus on Windows has been released](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/Focus-on-Windows). Github actions, Native App development in .NET 6, Azure SignalR and Desktop apps, and running WPF/Windows forms on Arm devices all make an appearance.  .NET Conf "Focus on Windows" is February 25, 2021, so sign up today.

### .NET News

[There's a proposal to allow Emojis in C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/4402) and I was about to {{CRY LAUGHING}} [but that's apparently not cool any more](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/14/tech/crying-laughing-emoji-gen-z/index.html) so I'll {{STREAMING TEARS}} instead.

[Tess Ferrandez updates her .NET debugging deep dive](https://tessferrandez.github.io/debugging/dotnet/labs/2008/02/04/debugging-demos-setup-instructions.html) Tess set up a lab to allow you to practice how to debug .NET application using tools like windbg and procdump.  This is an insanely informative and clearly written set of labs on how to master runtime debugging for .NET. 

{{BLOG}} Do you write ASP.NET Core Middleware? [Steve Collins breaks down the potential pitfalls when using dependencies and writing ASP.NET Core Middleware](https://stevetalkscode.co.uk/middleware-styles). This is one of those 'have it in your back pocket' blog posts for the next time you have to write middleware.

[System.Speech has been shipped as part of the Windows Compatibility Pack for .NET Core](https://twitter.com/terrajobst/status/1359282855747092483?s=20).  Still no cross-platform speech; but at least it's something.

[David Fowler talks about .NET APIs you probably didn't know existed](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.text.stringbuilder.getchunks?view=net-5.0), including StringBuilder.GetChunks which is not, I repeat, not, about cleaning up after a party.

### Microsoft News

{{SKELETON}} Microsoft is removing Edge legacy in April from Windows 10](https://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2021/02/ms-edge-chromium-update.html) Let's pour one out for browser competition.

### General Interest

{{SKELETON}} [Skeletons in the IT Closet: Seven Common Microsoft Active Directory Misconfigurations that Adversaries Abuse](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/seven-common-microsoft-ad-misconfigurations-that-adversaries-abuse/) This is more for the system adminstrator crowd but given that roles are getting blurred more and more, I thought I'd share.

{{BABY}} [The Rust Foundation is born](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-02-08-hello-world/) Given that it's Rust, I *had* to tell you about it. Microsoft has also joined the Rust foundation, which means you'll be hearing about Rust more from me.  Sorry?

### Jobs

{{FLAG}} [There's a new RFC out that for Structured Header fields in HTTPS](https://www.fastly.com/blog/improve-http-structured-headers) this is only about 25 years too late, but better late then never.
