## Last Week in .NET - February 13th, 2021

### Releases
[Visual Studio Code v1.53 has been released](https://code.visualstudio.com/updates/v1_53). You can now wrap tabs instead of horizontally scrolling when you have a lot of tabs open.  I feel seen.

### .NET Events

{{VIDEO}} [Scott Hunter, Director of Program Management for .NET, is giving a talk on the state of .NET 5 and what's coming in .NET 6](https://www.meetup.com/nopCommerce-Global-Meetup/events/275569812/?utm_content=153082719&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2384354214). It's an MS Teams event but let's not hold that against Scott. .NET 6 has big shoes to fill: It's the first LTS release under the ".NET" moniker; and it's when MAUI is due.  Special thanks to Ginny Caughey ([@gcaughey](https://twitter.com/gcaughey) on Twitter) for the link.

[The Event List for .NET Conf Focus on Windows has been released](https://channel9.msdn.com/Events/dotnetConf/Focus-on-Windows). Github actions, Native App development in .NET 6, Azure SignalR and Desktop apps, and running WPF/Windows forms on Arm devices all make an appearance.  .NET Conf "Focus on Windows" is February 25, 2021, so sign up today.

### .NET News

[There's a proposal to allow Emojis in C#](https://github.com/dotnet/csharplang/issues/4402) and I was about to {{CRY LAUGHING}} [but that's apparently not cool any more](https://www.cnn.com/2021/02/14/tech/crying-laughing-emoji-gen-z/index.html) so I'll {{STREAMING TEARS}} instead.

[Tess Ferrandez updates her .NET debugging deep dive](https://tessferrandez.github.io/debugging/dotnet/labs/2008/02/04/debugging-demos-setup-instructions.html) Tess set up a lab to allow you to practice how to debug .NET application using tools like windbg and procdump.  This is an insanely informative and clearly written set of labs on how to master runtime debugging for .NET. 

### Microsoft News

{{SKELETON}} Microsoft is removing Edge legacy in April from Windows 10](https://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2021/02/ms-edge-chromium-update.html) Let's pour one out for browser competition.

### General Interest

{{SKELETON}} [Skeletons in the IT Closet: Seven Common Microsoft Active Directory Misconfigurations that Adversaries Abuse](https://www.crowdstrike.com/blog/seven-common-microsoft-ad-misconfigurations-that-adversaries-abuse/) This is more for the system adminstrator crowd but given that roles are getting blurred more and more, I thought I'd share.

{{BABY}} [The Rust FOundation is born](https://foundation.rust-lang.org/posts/2021-02-08-hello-world/) Given that it's Rust, I *had* to tell you about it.
