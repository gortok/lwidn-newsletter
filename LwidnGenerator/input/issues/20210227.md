# Last Week in .NET - 27 February - 2021:  O POH Maoni!

### Releases

📢 [Python for Visual Studio Code](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/python/python-in-visual-studio-code-february-2021-release) introduces its February 2021 release. TensorBoard integration , better docstring and improved go to declaration behavior have all been released as a part of this... release.

📢 [TypeScript 4.2 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-2/) with several new features, like an abstract constructor signature, stricter checks for the 'in' Operator, smarter "Type alias preservation", and More.  Yes, and more is doing a bit of heavy lifting in that sentence. Check it out and rememberr that TypeScript does not respect SemVer so upgrading from 4.1->4.2 is a breaking change. Thanks, Microsoft.


### .NET News

📝 [Blazor Desktop: The Electron for .NET?](https://medium.com/young-coder/blazor-desktop-the-electron-for-net-ecdcf5c30027) by Matthew MacDonald asks this question. It's an interesting way of pitching Blazor that I hadn't considered previously; and I'm excited to see where this goes.  We do already have a perfectly good electron, however.

📝 [Did you see the .NET Foundation speaker's directory](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2021/02/19/blog/posts/announcing-the-dot-net-foundation-speakers-directory) If you want to book a speaker for your meetup, there are lots to choose from.  I am also in the directory, for what that is worth.

📝 [Khalid Abuhakmeh talks about 18 pitfalls you can encounter and EF Core 5 and how to avoid them](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2021/02/24/entity-framework-core-5-pitfalls-to-avoid-and-ideas-to-try) I've hit just about all of these in my work; and that's either an indictment of me or of the framework itself. You choose.

📝 [The four part series on building apps with Azure API Mangaement functions, Power Apps, and Logic Apps is now complete](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/aspnet/app-building-with-azure-api-management-functions-power-apps-and-logic-apps/) and it's clear from the title that Microsoft's KPIs for 2021 include how often Azure services are used in a blog post.

⚠ [NET 6 will *only* support Mac OS 10.14 and up](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0-supported-os.md#macos) Mac OS 10.13 "High Sierra" is 4 years old at this point, so who can blame them? Thanks to Kevin Jones (@vcsjones on twitter) for the link.

👨‍💻[Microsoft has a github repo devoted to WPF Samples](https://github.com/microsoft/WPF-Samples) and to my relief the only reference to azure in these code samples is the color.

🎉 [Maoni Stephens made "Partner" at Microsoft](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1365043906140729344?s=20) Maoni [has a neat video series out on the Garbage collector that I linked to a few newsletters ago](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3PDln7Z2I). And this promotion is well deserved. Congrats Maoni!

📝 [Speaking of Maoni, she also has a blog post out on the Pinned Object Heap in .NET 5](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/internals-of-the-poh/). The POH is new in .NET 5, and you may want to get acqauinted with it, just in case you ever need it.
