Not too much happened last week; but what did happen was rather alarming. Nothing like a Zero-day RCE in Microsoft Office to get your blood pumping. Let's get to it.

[Zero-day vuln in Microsoft Office: 'Follina' will work even when macros are disabled](https://www.theregister.com/2022/05/30/follina_microsoft_office_vulnerability/) This is a wild vulnerability that basically allows code execution even in a situation where you've explicitly set up Office to not allow code execution. Microsoft's response to this has been wishy-washy, by closing the initial report, and then saying, Yea, "msdt executing with macros disabled is an issue" and then opening [CVE-2022-30190](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-30190) for it.  This is not a rousing endorsement of when their PR and security practices collide. Oh, and in the intervening time [there was an unofficial patch released](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/windows-msdt-zero-day-vulnerability-gets-free-unofficial-patch/) if you are the daring sort.

Also shockingly, [the zero-day was mentioned in a 2020 thesis](https://twitter.com/cyb3rops/status/1531555087629357057). ðŸ¤¯

[Microsoft is on the cusp releasing 'classifiers' that will scan computers for messages that fit into one of several categories: "Leavers", "Corporate Sabotage", "Money Laundering", "Gifts & Entertainment", and more](https://twitter.com/never_released/status/1532718178115145728). Rightfully people bring up the false positive rate. I mean, who <i>wouldn't</i> accept a $50,000 bribe from me so I can get the new Elder Scrolls before it's released?  ðŸ™€

[Code Signing is moving to a hardware key that will absolutely make it harder to sign certificates](https://twitter.com/daveaglick/status/1532368131477356545).  If you can do your job, the security isn't strong enough. ðŸ“µ

[Amazon SNS for the .NET Developer, Getting Started Quick and Easy](https://twitter.com/rahulpnath/status/1532254733012189184) Everybody and everything claims to be quick and easy, just once I want someone to lean in to long and hard.  Like [Python the Hard Way](https://www.amazon.com/Learn-Python-Hard-Way-Introduction/dp/0321884914) (which by the way is a lie). ðŸŽ‚

[Cory Doctorow talks about Apple's sabotage of "Right to Repair"](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1531354587449417730) in a guargantuan twitter thread. In a time of rising inflation, we can ill afford the costs associated with a monopolized repair system. ðŸ›

[And lastly, Gen Z is smarter than all of us: Quit Early and Quit Often](https://twitter.com/richgel999/status/1531345091209613312).  If you want employees to be loyal, offer them contracts.  Contracts. With Severance.   Yea, I said it.
