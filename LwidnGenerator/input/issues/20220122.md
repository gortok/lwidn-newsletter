ðŸ•¹ [Microsoft to acquire Activision Blizzard to bring the joy and community of gaming to everyone across every device](https://news.microsoft.com/2022/01/18/microsoft-to-acquire-activision-blizzard-to-bring-the-joy-and-community-of-gaming-to-everyone-across-every-device/). Ok, first things first: The headline feels like PR B.S.  That's already possible and no acquistion would be necessary to continue that theme.  Microsoft is purchasing Blizzard for their IP.  Whether or not they'll follow through as they did with Bethesda and make some titles XBox only is anyone's guess (but probable).  This is one of those situations where there's all upside for Microsoft and not a lot of upside for anyone else.  Microsoft has had game studios in the past; and they generally don't fare well long term. If I were a betting man, I'd say in 10 years Activision will get spun back off into its own company.
