A few CVEs patched, a book written on Regex. It's an eventful week, let's dive in.

[.NET 7.0.0 Preview 4 is out](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/7.0/preview/7.0.0-preview.4.md). Looks like bug fixes here, nothing major. 🐛
<hr />

[.NET 6.0.5 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.5/6.0.5.md) which fixes three CVEs (all denial of service) and quite a few bugfixes. 🚨 

<hr />

[.NET 5.0.17 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/5.0/5.0.17/5.0.17.md) and it fixes those same three CVEs. 🚨 

<hr />

[.NET Core 3.1.25 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.25/3.1.25.md) and you guessed it, it fixes those same three CVEs. 🚨 

<hr />

That's it on the release side, here's what else happened Last Week in .NET:

[Khalid Abuhakmeh shares a tip on how to use the Convert class to convert a number into its binary representation](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1523685323875635200).  After working in embedded C this is one of those things that I'll never take for granted again. 🏗

[Microsoft launches [paid] cybersecurity services to help clients fight off ransomware and other attacks](https://twitter.com/kwestin/status/1523707560942964737). 
1. Build an insecure OS.  
2. Charge people to make it more secure.  
3. Profit.  


Even if this is all above board, [it sure looks twisted](https://www.cnbc.com/2022/05/09/microsoft-launches-security-experts-services-boosting-security-spend.html). 🟡

<hr />

Speaking of security vulnerabilities, CVE-2022-1388 is an F5 (network equipment) vulnerability, particularly against their REST APIs.  Yes, some network devices support REST API access to the control plane.    It's a wild world that I used to work in, and not without its share of problems. 🚨

<hr />

[WSL now supports USB devices](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/connect-usb).  Ouch. Microsoft makes a better linux than linux makes. 👉👈

<hr />

[Microsoft has a knowledgebase of styles of architecture for Azure](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/).  This is nice. More, please. 😊

<hr />

[Shiny.NET 2.5.1 is out](https://shinylib.net/release-notes/). What's Shiny.NET you ask? I really have no idea. The twitter account description says,

> "Make all your apps shiny with http://Shiny.NET -github.com/shinyorg/ - please don't @ for support - go to github!", 

and the Github description says, 

> "We make shiny nuget packages for Xamarin, Windows, & All Things .NET".  Again, no idea.  

If I go into the 'shiny' repository, it says, 

> "Shiny is a cross platform framework designed for Xamarin & UWP to make working with device services and background processes easy, testable, and consistent while bringing things like dependency injection & logging in a structured way to your code!"

...and that took long enough that I need a nap. 🤷‍♀️

<hr />


[I've touted Polly quite a few times here and elsewhere, and the .NET on AWS folks release a blog post series about it](https://nodogmablog.bryanhogan.net/2022/05/polly-with-net-6-part-5-using-a-cancellation-token).  With modern software, polly is a requirement. 🍾

<hr />

[Visual Studio 2022 17.2 is available](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1524095058173173761) and it includes support for C# 11's "raw string literals", and they're making the Razor editor better (thank heavens!). There are a lot more goodies in the release, so give it a look-see.

<hr />

[And the team that works on Visual Studio 2022 version 17.3 Preview 1 also released their latest update last week](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-preview#17.3.0-pre.1.0).  Lots of little fixes here, and if you like Preview bits, have at it. 🍾

<hr />

[Using the new .NET threading API sped up a benchmark by 4x](https://twitter.com/Aaronontheweb/status/1524720514475958273).  That's... a lot. I always thought .NET [Framework] was pretty fast, but to learn how much faster .NET [Core] is astonishes me. 🚄

<hr />

[Redefining the term 10x Developer](https://www.danclarke.com/redefining-the-term-10x-developer) The real 10x developers are the compilers we met along the way. 👋

<hr />

[A shockingly deep dive on Regex Improvements in .NET 7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/regular-expression-improvements-in-dotnet-7/) It's a 30 minute read from this point, and worth every minute. 📚
