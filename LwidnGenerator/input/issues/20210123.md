### Last Week in .NET - January 23rd, 2021

Is it over yet?  Maybe?  Not sure.  2021 has certainly come in like a lion, here's hoping is goes out like a lamb.  A new president here in the states, a renewed focus on science, and a bunch of things happened last week in .NET.  Let's get to it.

[Visual Studio 16.9 Preview 3 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-preview#16.9.0.pre.3.0)  We now have intellisense for PREPROCESSOR symbols (yea, that was a written pun).  This is about 20 years overdue and I'm excited to see it. Not excited enough to actually *inflict* PREPROCESSOR symbols on anyone, mind you, but excited nonetheless.
