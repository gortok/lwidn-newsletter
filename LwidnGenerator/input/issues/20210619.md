[Windows 10 supports ends On October 14, 2025](https://www.thurrott.com/windows/windows-10/251736/windows-10-support-ends-on-october-14-2025) according to a Microsoft support document. We're expecting Microsoft to unveil Windows 11 this week, but I gotta say: It's not going to be hard to get me off Windows 10 if Windows 11 promises less ads and less 'synergy'. Appropos of nothing [I bet this article on how to Disable OneDrive will be as useful to you as it is to me](https://www.howtogeek.com/225973/how-to-disable-onedrive-and-remove-it-from-file-explorer-on-windows-10/).

[Uno Platform 3.8 - New WinUI Calendar, Grid controls, 2x performance, new Linux scenario and more](https://platform.uno/blog/uno-platform-3-8-new-winui-calendar-grid-controls-2x-performance-new-linux-scenario-and-more/) is the tale of a headline that doesn't know what it wants to be when it grows up. Regardless, if you use Uno, a new version is out.

[Visual Studio teaches you how to use the updated C# language features](https://twitter.com/DennisCode/status/1403902572545462273) and this is pretty neat to watch.  I maintain, of course, that if the Egyptians had access to gifs they would have used them to communicate instead of emojis.

[New data access benchmarks for .NET 5 and .NET Framework 4.8](https://github.com/FransBouma/RawDataAccessBencher/blob/master/Results/20210615_netfx.txt) This benchmark covers all major ORMs (and Microsoft data access strategies like ADO.NET) and has been updated for .NET 5 and .NET Framework 4.8.

[Migration of Bing's Workflow Engine to .NET 5, by Ben Watson](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/migration-of-bings-workflow-engine-to-net-5/) The only fault I have with this blog post is that they never tell you what XAP stands for.  If you know, could you do me a solid and let *me* know, please?

[Richard Lander talks  with folks from the .NET team about "diagnostics" in another "Conversation" series](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/conversation-about-diagnostics/) The format is neat, even if the title is a little boring.  

Microsoft continues its tradition of parroting Mac by [parroting Mac OS X for Windows 11](https://twitter.com/daveaglick/status/1404842302506422275?s=20). I'm not even mad. That does look better. [Here's another article on Windows 11 updated look](https://petri.com/walking-through-windows-11), if you're interested in that sort of thing.

So good I'll share it twice. You wanted a .NET Repl, right? [Well now you've got one](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/dotnet-repl).

Thanks to Khalid Abuakmeh [I've learned that Entity Framework Core Exceptions are pretty nice](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1405165761962840064?s=20). It tells you the problem and how to fix it.  We're in 2021 folks, so this shouldn't be revolutionary, but it is.

Microsoft had an outage related to its Ubuntu repositories because of... [Diskspace issues](https://twitter.com/nixcraft/status/1405483187975819264). Ok, first off, #hugops to the team that had to deal with this outage. Second: You're the #2 cloud provider in the world.  You don't get to have diskspace issues, especially when you have invaded my desktop with "OneDrive". Those are the rules.

[Visual Studio 16.11 Prevoew 2 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2019-16-11-preview-2/) and this release includes lots of little fixes plus improvements for Git in Visual Studio.

And finally, [Juneteenth](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juneteenth) (June 19th) [was passed into US Law as a national holiday last week](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/juneteenth-national-holiday-now/story?id=78361064). You learn that not all of the confederacy surrendered on April 9, 1865, and that some (like Texas) decided to keep on until Union soldiers arrived on their doorstep.  June 19th, 1865 is the day that union soldiers arrived and told Black slaves they were finally free. Long overdue and a small step towards righting the wrongs of our history.

And that's it for what happened Last Week in .NET.  [If you're pursuing microservices, take my five day course](https://movetomicro.services) _before_ making the move.
