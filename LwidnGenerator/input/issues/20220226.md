.NET is humming along, MAUI is coming at some point, and all the C# 9 Records in your project should be in one file, says a .NET team member.

[Introducing the .NET 6 Runtime for AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-the-net-6-runtime-for-aws-lambda/) Congrats, you can now spend even less on your lambda functions by using the power of .NET 6. I just had a thought: As runtimes get faster, costs to run lambda functions will necessarily drop.  So if Amazon writes their own cloud native programming language, would they be incentivized to make it slow? ðŸŒ§

Technically this one is for next week, but [David Fowler woke up and chose violence](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1498136245188259840):

>  With records in C#, a type per file feels like a waste of space. How have you been organizing your code with records. 

I don't advocate internet dog-piling but this is just beyond the pale.   With the ratio (79 replies, 14 Retweets and 6 Quote Tweets) it's clear you all agree with me on this.  Seriously though, I like Records, but I don't see a reason to get away from the one-class-per-file, especially when the alternative is worse.

Think about it, would you rather have a file named `records.cs` that contains 50 class/records that represent all of the data-types in your application, or 50 files named what the record is? `employee.cs` for example?  Would you rather fight one horse-sized duck or 100 duck-sized horses?   ðŸ¦†

Last Week was light. Like, really light.  Part of it was me (I have toned down my twitter consumption), and part of it was that everyone's attention is focused on Russia invading Ukraine.  As of this writing, it appears public sentiment is against Russia, but that doesnt' mean much to the civilians and soliders in Ukraine fighting for their lives and homes.
