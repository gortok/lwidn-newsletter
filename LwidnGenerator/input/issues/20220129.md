Space Newts, a forgotten SDK, and Skynet.  Let's get into it.

[The .NET SDK is back!  on the Github Actions Ubuntu runner](https://github.com/actions/virtual-environments/issues/4424).  It was removed, and this was widely considered to be a bad idea. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[Damian Edwards wants to know if you're using C# records with Entity Framework in a web app](https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards/status/1486073246747283456)  Keep in mind, Damian works on the .NET Team. If he's having problems, what does that say about the rest of us?  Seriously though, this small example shows the warts when the pieces are put together in a whole, and it's nice to see dogfooding happening in public. üê∂

[The other Damian (Damian Hickey) brings up that the DNF project list is basically a who's who of groups inside of Microsoft](https://twitter.com/randompunter/status/1486256272336904194). Everyone else? Dead or dying. Do I agree with Damian on his proto-point, that it's the "customers" that have screwed .NET OSS?  No. Ultimately, it's the attitude inside of Microsoft towards OSS that has hurt .NET OSS. It's not as if people inside of Microsoft are rubbing their hands together and cackling while they dream up ways to hurt Open Source software.  No, it's far more insidious -- it's that the incentives naturally will have a negative consequence on any OSS that isn't _Microsoft Driven_.  Do their OKRs or KPIs include metrics to drive an increase in community-led projects? No. A fun game I like to play called "imagine how the other side thinks" is to go through what incentives would have to exist for a company to behave the way it's behaving.  With the dearth of community-led sustainable OSS projects, it's clear that Microsoft doesn't track them at all, and certanly has no KPIs related to their health.üò∑

[Announcing .NET Community Toolkit v8.0.0 Preview 1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/announcing-net-community-toolkit-v8-0-0-preview-1/) The 'toolkit' includes the [HighPerformance package, which is like nitrous oxide for your code](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/communitytoolkit/high-performance/introduction).üõ†

[Issue opening/installing .NET 6.0.10, 3.1.416, 5.0.404 from the installer package on MacOS 12.2 (Monterey RC)](https://github.com/dotnet/installer/issues/13117)  For a short while, you could not install .NET on the RC for the new MacOS (Monterey).  It has now been fixed, with no indication as to what actually fixed it coming from Apple, and this is why transparency is good.  Don't be like Apple. Be transparent about bugs.üçé

[Dartosz talks compiler performance in a twitter thread](https://twitter.com/badamczewski01/status/1486640435636355076). Every so often you'll have heard me say this: It's this sort of stuff that keeps me on twitter.  These are random deep dives that wouldn't make sense in a high friction writing environment, but are perfect for Twitter. üßµ

[.NET 7 will support `ref` fields](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/63768). Your engineers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn‚Äôt stop to think if they should. üêí

[Kaggle can solve Wordle just by the boxes it sees on twitter](https://www.kaggle.com/benhamner/wordle-1-6) Please do not hand Kaggle admin privileges.  It's Skynet in a trenchcoat. ü§ñ

The... Vagina Museum (sorry, corporate spam filters) [covers the ST:VOY episode where Tom Paris and Captain Janeway get turned into newts and have kids](https://twitter.com/vagina_museum/status/1487063667384459264). And by 'covers' I mean they explain the various way space newts would have kids.  This is hilarous and scientifically interesting all at the same time  (Also, *this* sort of story telling is what they ditched DS9 for? Hrmph).
<hr />
[ALEXA, INSTALL Alexa.NET 1.20.0](https://twitter.com/timheuer/status/1487430402759446536) Haha. That's an audio only joke.  Alexa.NET 1.20.0 is out. ü§ñ

And that's it for what happened Last Week in .NET.
