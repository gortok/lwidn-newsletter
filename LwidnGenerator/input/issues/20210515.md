[Dave a Brock writes on how to use Configuration with C# 9 Top Level Programs](https://www.daveabrock.com/2021/01/19/config-top-level-programs/) One of the nicer features of C# 9 was pulling out the ceremony of the `Main` method.  Dave uses this blog post to show how you can use configuration in this new world of no `Main` method.  Now if only there weren't years of documentation showing varying ways to use configuration for varying versions of .NET Core.

[There's an Adobe Reader 0day vulnerability that's been exploited in the wild](https://twitter.com/ryanaraine/status/1392135493437956100?s=20) this is part of CVE-2021-28550, and as usual patch when you can, as soon as you can.

[CVE-2021-31204 is an Elevation of Privilege Vulnerability that affects Single File Deployment applications on Mac and Linux](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/52608) and the latest patch fixes this vulnerability; so again, patch your systems if you're on .NET Core 5.05 or lower, or .NET Core 3.1.14 or lower.

What you would probably notice is that this version now includes Xcode 12.5 support.  This version also fixes the aforementioned CVE as well as CVE-2021-27068 which is a Remote Code Execution vulnerability that could affect you if you use Python.exe in a scripts subfolder.  If you do use Python with Visual Studio I'd like to point out that you're rarer than an honest politician.

[\[Microsoft\] Office based malware is "one of the biggest threats to companies" and yet it seemingly gets very little attention from Microsoft on how to mitigate it](https://twitter.com/NathanMcNulty/status/1392352785694281730?s=20).  Instead of making a better zipper, Microsoft chooses to tattoo ["Remember to close the barn door" on people's hands](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/microsoft-security-baselines/security-baseline-for-microsoft-365-apps-for-enterprise-v2104/ba-p/2307695).
