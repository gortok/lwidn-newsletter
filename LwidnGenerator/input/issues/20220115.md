CSharpFritz (Jeff Fritz) sits down and [programs a Discord Chatbot with C# 6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SDuG0zTLe18).  I notionally know what Discord is, and I notionally know what a chatbot does, but this feels a bit "Hello fellow kids" for me.  Maybe I'm getting old?

[.NET Developer? You're an IoT developer too!](https://blues.io/blog/dot-net-developer-iot-too/) according to a company that makes a living selling IoT devices that run .NET.  Sardony aside; .NET in the IoT space is one of those things I find refreshing.  I've done firmware work in C, and I would have given my kingdom for a SoC that could support .NET. (.NET wasn't there yet in 2015).  One of the few reasons why I'd go back to full time employment *is* IoT with .NET. If you're hiring in that realm, shoot me an email at george+iotrocks (at) georgestocker.com. 


[Write cloud free code?](https://klo.dev/) What? Is this like Dapr (not the ORM) with infrastruture layer plugins?

[VisualStudioMagazine.com writes "With many options, .NET Dev Asks for Tech CHoice Help: 'I Am Lost'"](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2022/01/11/net-tech-help.aspx?m=1). Ok, let's unpack this. Converge360, which operates Visual Studio Magazine, is wholly owned by 1105 Media, and is a B2B magazine service (if you want a magazine for your business, you contract with them and they do it).

So, Microsoft said (either explicitly or implcitly), "We need more eyeballs on our .NET Tech Community Forums", and *this* is the best that they could come up with, the trial and tribulations of one NickJ911.

It would be embarassing if it weren't so on brand for Microsoft.  The .NET Tech Community forums [have fewer posts than a knitting forum](https://forum.knittinghelp.com/), and as a free bit of advice, let me explain why that is: _astroturfing doesn't work._ I've said it before: Stack Overflow was the perfect property for Microsoft to purchase. it started with two stalwarts in the .NET World (Joel Spolsky and Jeff Atwood), its initial audience was .NET, and even 14 years later, [.NET is most popular](https://insights.stackoverflow.com/survey/2021#section-most-popular-technologies-other-frameworks-and-libraries).  Microsoft keeps trying to make its own .NET watering hole, with [Microsoft Q&A](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/index.html) and now this, but they're not getting the traffic they should be getting, because Microsoft's reasons for doing it don't match what the community wants or needs.  Microsoft is the second largest company by market capitalization, and they should start acting like it. Instead of continually building something that isn't in their DNA, they need to buy it and let it thrive by keeping their hands off.
