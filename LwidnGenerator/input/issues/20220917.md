I don't know if I told you this, but [Khalid Abuakmeh is on a mission to change the name from .NET to dotnet](https://twitter.com/hashtag/dropthedot?src=hashtag_click).   

I get it. I do. .NET is hard to search for, people end up typing .net or dot net or dotnet anyway, so why not just make the name what the people type?

I can see their point of view. It's not like the .NET name means anything anyway,  I mean, heck, [even Microsoft couldn't explain it](https://www.cnet.com/tech/tech-industry/net-name-ties-microsoft-in-knots/).

But ultimately, rebranding efforts are hard enough with a company good at (what amounts to) consumer marketing.  And that's an area of growth for Microsoft.

With that aside, let's get into what happened Last Week in .NET.

There were a flurry of releases last week (speaking of, what do you call multiple releases? Is it a flurry?)  with [.NET 7.0 RC 1](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/7.0/preview/7.0.0-rc.1.md), [.NET 6.0.9](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.9/6.0.9.md and [.NET 3.1.29](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.29/3.1.29.md) all getting version bumps. All of these releases address a CVE with the model binder under the CVE Number CVE-2022-38013.

I give it about 2 years until Microsoft dumps version numbers entirely and moves to [CalVer](https://calver.org/).  This is simply an unsustainable Pace of version numbers. üìÖ

Because we all need a little fun in our life; [a joke design ended up making the N-Gage what it was](https://twitter.com/AngrySkycrane/status/1569458497510670336).  Also, if you're of the demographic that doesn't know the G-word in that article, I recommend... No, I strongly recommend... No, let me try again: DO NOT GOOGLE THAT WORD. There. I warned you. üêê

[The current work in progress to get Linux (?) controls working on MAUI](https://github.com/jsuarezruiz/maui-linux/pull/37). I want to believe. üõ∏

[The .NET foundation is removing its $100 membership fee](https://twitter.com/dotnetfdn/status/1570045953997946880).  I'd rather they keep the $100 membership fee and act like an independent open source foundation instead of a mouthpiece for whatever antics Microsoft is up to in the .NET space.  It's not even subtle at this point. üí∏

[Entity Framework 7 RC 1 is out](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-ef7-rc1/), and I'm glad they dropped the 'core' moniker because this isn't just the essentials any more, this rivals the size of EF 6. üë£

[Custom Dev Container Features](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2022/09/15/dev-container-features) for when you want to install development needs via Docker for VS Code. üö¢

[Uber was hacked in part because the attacker told them he was hacking them and they thought it was a joke](https://twitter.com/RachelTobac/status/1570611575152848900). I can't add a punchline to that. üôä

[.NET 7 static AOT Initialization being demonstrated in drawing a circle, with ... no code to compute the circle.](https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1570764822308069378) I agree with Miguel on this one, that's... impressive. ü§Ø

[Geoff Huntley explains why it's legally problematic to use VS code](https://ghuntley.com/fracture/).  I'm not saying I agree with the viewpoint, but I agree we need to look at these things more critically. ü§®

Sorry for the lateness on this one, I'm currently going through a surprise Bathroom Remodel.
