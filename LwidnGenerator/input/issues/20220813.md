We've got a few new releases this week, some light corporate guerilla warfare at Github, and the third kind of lie, Statistics.  Let's get into it.

[.NET 7 Preview 7 is out, and this will be the last Preview](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-7-preview-7/).  The next release will be an "RC". 🆕

<hr />

[.NET 6.0.8 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.8/6.0.8.md) and it fixes CVE-2022-34716 a .NET Information disclosure vulnerability. 🆕

<hr />

[.NET 3.1.28 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.28/3.1.28.md) and it fixes this same vulnerability. 🆕

<hr />

[Announcing .NET Framework 4.8.1](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-dotnet-framework-481/) and the big thing they're announcing are accessibility updates. If there's more, it's not being broadcast very loudly. 🆕

<hr />

[Kevin Jones (@vcsjones on twitter) continues his thread on new happenings in System.Security.Cryptography](https://twitter.com/vcsjones/status/1512607268872802314).  I tried to punch up that sentence as much as possible, but writing about Cryptography can be as boring as it is important. Luckily Kevin makes it interesting. 🔐

<hr />

[Microsoft Teams has 7x the Daily Active Users that Slack has](https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1558054445237149697).  In completely unrelated news, Teams [starts up automatically when Windows loads](http://woshub.com/disable-teams-autostart/) and there is no way on God's Green Earth that affects the DAU count at all. Ok, so I lied. They are related. ♊

<hr />

[Powerpoint now offers Dark Mode because we've completely lost the plot](https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1557788946507120642) and do things because we can, and not because of their original meaning.  🌃

<hr />

[Kevlin Henney writes an article for O'Reilly on ML and Scaling False Peaks](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/scaling-false-peaks/).  It's worth your time.🏔

<hr />

[Virtual Formatter in ReSharper 2022.2](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2022/08/11/virtual-formatter-in-resharper-2022-2/). I've read the blog post twice and I really don't understand what this thing does. 🤷‍♀️

<hr />

[Visual Studio for Mac 17.3 is now available](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-17-3-is-now-available/) Lots of Goodies here, and I didn't know the [StringSyntaxAttribute](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/62505) was a thing but I think I'm going to use that going forward. 🍬

<hr />

Nothing like a little light insurrection for a monday morning. [Lucas Garron from Github shares a tweet warning that Github is changing their policy on non-essential cookies]. Github used to have a policy of not tracking their users (the only used essential cookies) but now they're making a switch and adding non-essential cookies to the list of cookies they 'offer'. Frankly I'm surprised that Microsoft's KPIs allowed them to even [make it two years without reversing course](https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/), and I hope we see more of these corporate guerilla tactics.  Of course for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction, and I'll just leave that there for you to think about. 😐

<hr />

The "Multi-Platform" part of MAUI has a giant asterisk, of course, and that is if you want Linux support, [it's gotta be supported by the community](https://twitter.com/sinclairinat0r/status/1557132451750748162).  Here's where the "What's good for the open-source platform is bad for Microsoft" tussle comes to a head.  It's great for open source to have Linux as a first class citizen, but that's bad for Microsoft.  🐧

<hr />

So if you know what `%2f` means in URL land, you're [gonna want to know about this change in behavior for Kestrel](https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues/28965).  I seemingly had to deal [with this same sort of problem way back in the .NET 4.0 days](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7251285/iis-treats-double-encoded-forward-slashes-in-urls-differently-on-the-first-reque) and unfortunately never got it resolved.  🐛

<hr />

[#OnDotNETLive talks about a new open source data processing framework for .NET](https://twitter.com/cecilphillip/status/1556685393445240832). I love the smell of ETL in the morning. 🍵

<hr />

[Rider 2022.2 includes some new features for C# 11](https://twitter.com/JetBrainsRider/status/1556656477846249476) and this reminds me I really ought to give Rider a try.  Even with VS 2022 Resharper is still indispensible (especially vs. that weird AI/Intellisense thing Microsoft is trying out). ✨

<hr />

[Apparently Ready Player One was wrong about the first easter egg](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z97TfAhDKGk&t=480s) proving that if you want to get the right answer on the internet, just post the wrong one. 🥚

<hr />

And that's it for what happened Last Week in .NET.
