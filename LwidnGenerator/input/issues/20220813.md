[Kevin Jones (@vcsjones on twitter) continues his thread on new happenings in System.Security.Cryptography](https://twitter.com/vcsjones/status/1512607268872802314).  I tried to punch up that sentence as much as possible, but writing about Cryptography can be as boring as it is important. Luckily Kevin makes it interesting.

[Microsoft Teams has 7x the Daily Active Users that Slack has](https://twitter.com/Carnage4Life/status/1558054445237149697).  In completely unrelated news, Teams [starts up automatically when Windows loads](http://woshub.com/disable-teams-autostart/) and there is no way on God's Green Earth that affects the DAU count at all. Ok, so I lied. They are related.

[Powerpoint now offers Dark Mode because we've completely lost the plot](https://twitter.com/Microsoft/status/1557788946507120642) and do things because we can, and not because of their original meaning.  

[Kevlin Henney writes an article for O'Reilly on ML and Scaling False Peaks](https://www.oreilly.com/radar/scaling-false-peaks/).  It's worth your time.

[Virtual Formatter in ReSharper 2022.2](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2022/08/11/virtual-formatter-in-resharper-2022-2/). I've read the blog post twice and I really don't understand what this thing does.

[Visual Studio for Mac 17.3 is now available](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-for-mac-17-3-is-now-available/) Lots of Goodies here, and I didn't know the [StringSyntaxAttribute](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/62505) was a thing but I think I'm going to use that going forward.

Nothing like a little light insurrection for a monday morning. Lucas Garron from Github shares a tweet about a change to the fact that Github used to have a policy of not tracking their users (the only used essential cookies) but now they're making a switch and adding non-essential cookies to the list of cookies they 'offer'. Frankly I'm surprised that Microsoft's KPIs allowed them to even [make it two years without reversing course](https://github.blog/2020-12-17-no-cookie-for-you/).
