üìÜ July 29th is .NET "Focus on F#" Day. You can sign up to watch a whole day of videos on F# at [focus.dotnetconf.net](https://focus.dotnetconf.net).  I haven't ever seen a CFP for these "Focus" events so I'm unsure of how they pick their speakers; but it looks like a good lineup.

üè™ [Microsoft publishes its own applications through the Microsoft Store](https://twitter.com/RudyHuyn/status/1414705187898347522?s=20), making it about 95% of the Microsoft Store.

üìπ On July 8th, ]Kathleen Dollard, Rich Lander, and Immo Landwerth 'sat down' on youtube to talk about What's new in .NET 6 Preview 6 & 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0LTqwTojlA), and how they handle "breaking changes".  Which they can handle now that they aren't wed to "Don't break anything at all costs" .NET Framework.

üíÅ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Bill Wagner and Beth Massi talk to .NET Notts about what the .NET Foundation does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apd61znmCuY), and that's important because

‚òë The [.NET Foundation 2021 Board Nominations are open](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=8ru98HbNZ0mMTFCoAnRpEmp3qxxG5iNBl2dHcSfTzztUOEdKT05ENERURFFIMTFOSDU3TE81NFJDQi4u) but don't get your hopes up because there's a nomination committee who will decide who actually gets voted on.  There's [also a job description of what board members do, if you're interested](https://dotnetfoundation.sharepoint.com/Shared%20Documents/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2FShared%20Documents%2FNomination%20Committee%20Documents%2FBoard%2Dmember%2Dresponsibilities%2Epdf&parent=%2FShared%20Documents%2FNomination%20Committee%20Documents&p=true&originalPath=aHR0cHM6Ly9kb3RuZXRmb3VuZGF0aW9uLnNoYXJlcG9pbnQuY29tLzpiOi9nL0VWcGpOMnlrY0tKR2tmUGpid2JUTklVQl9XT1Z0REFFRWxDLXhYQ21FaDVRelE_cnRpbWU9YlB5akItZEsyVWc).

‚è© [The ASP.NET Community Standup - Building with Blazor happened last week](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ZkKzebpkByxv) and it shows how Powered4.tv was built using Blazor.

üì¢ [.NET 5.0.8 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-july-2021/).  The interesting bit here is that now you can use Windows Forms and WPF are supported for Arm64. This was initially in .NET 6 Preview 1 and backported to .NET 5.0 with this release.

üì¢ [.NET Core 3.1.17 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.17/3.1.17.md). Several non-security bug fixes are in this release.

0Ô∏è‚É£ [Microsoft Patches 3 Under-Attack Windows Zero-Days](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-patches-3-under-attack-windows-zero-days) the big news here is that if you have Windows Systems, you'll have already wanted to patch them. If not, patch them now.  One of the three Zero-days includes a drive-by attack via web browsers.  Second to that is that there are 117 vulnerabilities patched, with 17 labeled 'critical'.

üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ [You know you can run multiple projects when you hit 'F5' in Visual Studio, right?](https://twitter.com/AndySterland/status/1415028388520087553?s=20) I love the gif method of teaching; and because of that I'll forgive the horrible experience we've taught ourselves is adequate with debugging multiple projects via F5.  

üåé [Global Usings are in .NET 6](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1415285907951869952?s=20) and this seems like something that will in no way ever be abused or lead programmers to wonder what namespaces are avialable. 

‚òÅ [Microsoft introduced the Windows 365 Cloud PC last week](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/07/14/introducing-a-new-era-of-hybrid-personal-computing-the-windows-365-cloud-pc/) and the interesting bit here is that now you can build Windows applications without needing windows.  You'll never have to worry about zero-days plaguing your personal computer, and you'll get to snobbishly remind people that you use linux all at the same time! As usual [the licensing situation with Windows 365 is inscrutable to mere mortals](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/get-started-with-windows-365/ba-p/2530504).

üì¢ [Announcing .NET 6 Preview 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-6/) with the previously mentioned Arm64 support, Apple Silicon support.

üì¢ [Visual Studio 2022 Preview 2 is out](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-preview-2-is-out/) and it includes Web Live Preview for ASP.NET? Wait a second.  ASP.NET... Webforms?  That's still a thing?  There's doubling down on an old technology, and then theres... this.

üìù [The Microsoft Windows Developer Team has their 'notes' publicly visible for Windows Development](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/devnotes/developer-notes) and these pages are chock-full of interesting tidbits. If you find yourself doing native Windows development, you'll want to bookmark this.

üì¢ [ML.NET 1.6 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/releases) and it now supports Apple's Silicon, along with several other fixes.

üòú [Microsoft released a new emoji introduction video](https://twitter.com/sdw/status/1415705990431793153) and whatever team did this needs to be responsible for the Windows Experience in general. I have a feeling they could do better than what we've got.

üö´üêß [System.Drawing.Common will be Windows-only in .NET 6](https://github.com/dotnet/designs/pull/234).  While a good move, it feels like 'Common' isn't.  Programmer hubris comes for us all in the end.


and Lastly,

A helpful tip for debugging, [you can use Debugger.IsAttached as a way to catch Exceptions](https://twitter.com/davidpine7/status/1415877304383950848?s=20), but wouldn't you just click the 'Break on All Exceptions' checkbox in Visual Studio? How is this different from that?


And that's it for what happened Last Week in .NET.
