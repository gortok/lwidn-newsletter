July 29th is .NET "Focus on F#" Day. You can sign up to watch a whole day of videos on F# at [focus.dotnetconf.net](https://focus.dotnetconf.net).  I haven't ever seen a CFP for these "Focus" events so I'm unsure of how they pick their speakers; but it looks like a good lineup.

[Microsoft publishes its own applications through the Microsoft Store](https://twitter.com/RudyHuyn/status/1414705187898347522?s=20), making it about 95% of the Microsoft Store.

On July 8th, ]Kathleen Dollard, Rich Lander, and Immo Landwerth 'sat down' on youtube to talk about What's new in .NET 6 Preview 6 & 7](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J0LTqwTojlA), and how they handle "breaking changes".  Which they can handle now that they aren't wed to "Don't break anything at all costs" .NET Framework.

[Bill Wagner and Beth Massi talk to .NET Notts about what the .NET Foundation does](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=apd61znmCuY).  

[The ASP.NET Community Standup - Building with Blazor happened last week](https://www.pscp.tv/w/1ZkKzebpkByxv) and it shows how Powered4.tv was built using Blazor.

[.NET 5.0.8 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-july-2021/).  The interesting bit here is that now you can use Windows Forms and WPF are supported for Arm64. This was initially in .NET 6 Preview 1 and backported to .NET 5.0 with thsir eelase.

[.NET Core 3.1.17 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.17/3.1.17.md). Several non-security bug fixes are in this release.

[Microsoft Patches 3 Under-Attack Windows Zero-Days](https://www.securityweek.com/microsoft-patches-3-under-attack-windows-zero-days) the big news here is that if you have Windows Systems, you'll have already wanted to patch them. If not, patch them now.  One of the three Zero-days includes a drive-by attack via web browsers.  Second to that is that there are 117 vulnerabilities patched, with 17 labeled 'critical'.

[You know you can run multiple projects when you hit 'F5' in Visual Studio, right?](https://twitter.com/AndySterland/status/1415028388520087553?s=20) I love the gif method of teaching; and because of that I'll forgive the horrible experience we've taught ourselves is adequate with debugging multiple projects via F5.  

[Global Usings are in .NET 6](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1415285907951869952?s=20) and this seems like something that will in no way ever be abused or lead programmers to wonder what namespaces are avialable. 

[Microsoft introduced the Windows 365 Cloud PC last week](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/blog/2021/07/14/introducing-a-new-era-of-hybrid-personal-computing-the-windows-365-cloud-pc/) and the interesting bit here is that now you can build Windows applications without needing windows.  You'll never have to worry about zero-days plaguing your personal computer, and you'll get to snobbishly remind people that you use linux all at the same time! As usual [the licensing situation with Windows 365 is inscrutable to mere mortals](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/windows-it-pro-blog/get-started-with-windows-365/ba-p/2530504).
