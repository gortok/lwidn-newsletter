Another lite week. It's been almost a month since the last set of releases for .NET (Core), and while that isn't a long time, it just _feels_ like a long time.

However, there's still (mostly good) stuff to share this week, so let's get to it.

[Microsoft was able to detect and mitigate Russian Cyber attacks on Ukraine within hours of them launching prior to the invasion](https://twitter.com/MaybeImALeo/status/1498520689271136259).  I give Microsoft a lot of crap when they aren't doing the right thing, so it's only fair to call out how they were able to mitigate a novel cyber attack within hours of it being launched. That really is impressive and a credit to the security engineers at Microsoft. 👏

[Design Systems are for user interfaces](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/design-systems-are-for-user-interfaces/) Design Systems are like onions. They have layers. What about Cakes? Cakes have layers.  Parfait. Everyone loves parfait. 🎂

[The F# Foundation Strongly condemns the Russian Invasion of Ukraine](https://twitter.com/fsharporg/status/1499072151575531522). There really isn't much anyone can do outside of condemn or boycott.  It's like that old joke, where does an elephant sit? Wherever it wants.  🐘

[Miguel De Icaza is leaving Microsoft](https://www.zdnet.com/article/former-xamarin-co-founder-miguel-de-icaza-is-leaving-microsoft/) I can't speak to why Miguel is leaving Microsoft and the timing may be coincidental [with the recent fallout over the DevDiv President and the Hot Reload issue](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2021/10/25/net-hot-reload.aspx) that would have assuredly gone against MDI's viewpoint on how that should have been handled, but either way Microsoft is losing a visionary on how to attract the open-source world to Microsoft's efforts in OSS. 👋

[How to share code between ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/sharing-code-between-aspnet-and-aspnetcore) More people have to do this than we'd all like, and I'm glad this sort of view is out there.  It'll be another 10 years before Webforms is dead dead, and that's if we're lucky.  🚛

[Microsoft extends termination date for employee so they can attend to a family emergency](https://twitter.com/vBenArmstrong/status/1499933136607612928) This is a wonderful happy-ending story of Microsoft using its abilities to ensure a departing H1-B visa employee can fly back to their native country to care for a family member, which normally would have terminated their visa on their termination date.  This was a good move on Microsoft's part, although an indictment of our current H-1B Visa program. 💳

And that's it for what happened last week in .NET, as always, if you have interesting content you think I should know about, you can @ me on twitter @gortok, or you can email me at george@georgestocker.com.  Yes, that is a very creative email address. Thank you for noticing. 💙
