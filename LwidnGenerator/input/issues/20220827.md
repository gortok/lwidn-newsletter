No major releases, but a few cool trinkets being dropped, and Microsoft embraces ads.  And when I say "embraces", I mean "weds".

[Taytay shares tips on ensuring Windows Defender can update, even when networking is broken in a corporate environment](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1562190352278487041).  Taylor Swift and SwiftOnSecurity are national treasures. 🏴‍☠️

Zoom [appears to be in a battle with Microsoft Teams for the enterprise collaboration tool](https://twitter.com/ETribuneTech/status/1562055381777584132).  Microsoft teams as a collaboration product is only slightly better than duct-taping Sharepoint, Lync, Yammer, and Outlook together. As a video conference tool, it's not half bad. I literally tried to schedule a teams meeting in teams and couldn't get it to give me a Video conferencing option.  At this point, Microsoft's biggest competition in this space is their own product ineptness.  (Also if you work on the Microsoft Teams product, blink twice if you get a demerit every time you suggest a product improvement). 👀

[Microsoft is putting more ads in Outlook on iOS and Android: Free users can avoid most of them by using Focused Inbox](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1561891559963910144). I've been accused of putting Microsoft in a bad light, but I don't even need to add any commentary to this one. 🙊

[In .NET 7, the .NET Runtime Windows IO Threadpool and Timer Queue are now fully managed code](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1561442085349126144). One step closer to a completely managed code runtime (is such a thing even possible?) ⏰

[C# 11 preview: Generic Math, required members, optional types, and more](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp-11-preview-august-update/). I made one of those up, can you tell which one? 🙈

[EF Core Power Tools has had 250.000 installs!](https://twitter.com/ErikEJ/status/1561765695146397696) Why are they rounding to three decimal places for whole num--- oh.  Yea, 250,000 is much better than 250. Incidentally, I've spoken quite a few times in this newsletter about the lack of work-life balance on the EF team, and [one of their members says the quiet part out loud](https://twitter.com/bricelambs/status/1561804274757013505).  "How did your marriage end, dad?" "Entity Framework, son. Entity Framework." 

It's also worth noting that no one has to say anything to know whether they have a good work-life balance or not.  When you see a team churn out updates at a breakneck pace for years, you can look at the fricking commit log and see the problem. You don't need anyone to tweet about it. 🤯

[Microsoft's new tool let's you see your systems like a hacker would](https://twitter.com/ddskier/status/1561821512017100800) I hope the hackers would remove the ads first.  Seeing Office, Outlook, and Windows without ads would be a welcome change. 😏

By default, Corporate Windows 10 can't repair itself. [Taytay (long may they reign) shares a registry key hack you should implement if you work in Corporate IT](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1561827619242475521). 🛠

If you want a Batch script that sets up a new project, [Eric Potter has got you covered](https://humbletoolsmith.com/2022/08/18/quickly-create-test-solutions-by-scripting-the-dotnet-cli/).  I would deduct points for it not being in Perl, but given that this is a windows system Perl is not available by default. 📜

Sharing because Kelsey Hightower's work is good and not a reflection on Kubernetes abilities as a platform: [Learn Kubernetes the Hard Way](https://github.com/kelseyhightower/kubernetes-the-hard-way/blob/master/docs/01-prerequisites.md). 🦺

[Matt Damon provides insights in why they don't make movies like they used to](https://twitter.com/NickJBrumfield/status/1562034829125902337).  I'm not a big fan of the whole "eat wings" part of the "eat wings and share insights", but I'll take the insights any day of the week. 🐥

[The F# folks are a little upset that Microsoft isn't pushing F#](https://twitter.com/dustinmoris/status/1562390751220219905).  Once Microsoft's customers (CIOs) start to adopt F# for their applications, Microsoft will pay attention to it. Until then, the scraps from the table are as good as it gets. 🗑

[dodyg shares how to put anti-forgery tokens into a minimal API](https://github.com/dodyg/practical-aspnetcore/tree/net6.0/projects/minimal-api/anti-forgery-3). Good stuff. 🕵🏻‍♂️

[TypeScript 4.8 is out](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-8/) Lots of goodies, but as always, even though TypeScript is installed via NPM and NPM asks that packages respect SemVer, TypeScript is special and does not. That makes any upgrade a breaking change. Good luck! 🥂

[Built in Container Support in the .NET SDK](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-builtin-container-support-for-the-dotnet-sdk/) I don't quite see how this works; I'll have to give a try to see what it does. But, it looks cool?🍟

<hr />

And that's it for what happened Last Week in .NET. Should you see anything cool, share it with me [@gortok](https://twitter.com/gortok) on twitter.
