[Taytay shares tips on ensuring Windows Defender can update, even when networking is broken in a corporate environment](https://twitter.com/SwiftOnSecurity/status/1562190352278487041).  Taylor Swift and SwiftOnSecurity are national treasures.

Zoom [appears to be in a battle with Microsoft Teams for the enterprise collaboration tool](https://twitter.com/ETribuneTech/status/1562055381777584132).  Microsoft teams as a collaboration product is only slightly better than duct-taping Sharepoint, Lync, Yammer, and Outlook together. As a video conference tool, it's not half bad. I literally tried to schedule a teams meeting in teams and couldn't get it to give me a Video conferencing option.  At this point, Microsoft's biggest competition in this space is their own product ineptness.  (Also if you work on the Microsoft Teams product, blink twice if you get a demerit every time you suggest a product improvement).

[Microsoft is putting more ads in Outlook on iOS and Android: Free users can avoid most of them by using Focused Inbox](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1561891559963910144). I've been accused of putting Microsoft in a bad light, but I don't even need to add any commentary to this one. 

[In .NET 7, the .NET Runtime Windows IO Threadpool and Timer Queue are now fully managed code](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1561442085349126144). One step closer to a completely managed code runtime (is such a thing even possible?)

[C# 11 preview: Generic Math, required members, optional types, and more](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/csharp-11-preview-august-update/). I made one of those up, can you tell which one?

[EF Core Power Tools has had 250.000 installs!](https://twitter.com/ErikEJ/status/1561765695146397696) Why are they rounding to three decimal places for whole num--- oh.  Yea, 250,000 is much better than 250. Incidentally, I've spoken quite a few times in this newsletter about the lack of work-life balance on the EF team, and [one of their members says the quiet part out loud](https://twitter.com/bricelambs/status/1561804274757013505).  "How did your marriage end, dad?" "Entity Framework, son. Entity Framework." 

It's also worth noting that no one has to say anything to know whether they have a good work-life balance or not.  When you see a team churn out updates at a breakneck pace for years, you can look at the fricking commit log and see the problem. You don't need anyone to tweet about it.

[Microsoft's new tool let's you see your systems like a hacker would](https://twitter.com/ddskier/status/1561821512017100800) I hope the hackers would remove the ads first.  Seeing Office, Outlook, and Windows without ads would be a welcome change.
