As promised this week is what we like to call a greatest clicks week.  Or a week where I share (from the first half of the year) the greatest clicks on Last Week in .NET. It's what you clicked on the most, so enjoy this trip down greatest clicks lane.  I am out on a much needed "vacation" (do parents with young children actually have vacations? We'll find out), and will be back in a few weeks. Until then, here's something to remember me by.

### January

📝[Julie Lerman blogs about using C#9 records as Domain Driven Design immutable value objects in C# 9](https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/domain-driven-design-csharp) I love Julie's writing, and I hope you'll enjoy it too.


📝[Khalid Abuhakmeh writes about what he's learned in his time in .NET](https://khalidabuhakmeh.com/secrets-of-a-dotnet-professional) and there are some good lessons in there. Give it a read.

📝[Jennifer Riggins talks about why Tech is still toxic for women](https://thenewstack.io/why-tech-is-still-toxic-for-women-and-what-to-do-about-it/) Our best days are ahead, but we're not going to get there if we're making it impossible for half the population to be a part of tech. Read this article. Internalize it.

📝[Dean Ward of Stack Overflow details how they (ab)use IConfiguration](https://bakedbean.org.uk/posts/2021-01-fun-with-iconfiguration/) If you find yourself with environment and tenet configuration settings; check this post out. (Author's note: Dean left Stack Overflow during the Great Resignation of 2021 -- which happens to coincide with a 6 months [after Stack Overflow was acquired by Prosus](https://www.forbes.com/sites/vijaygurbaxani/2021/06/08/the-18-billion-acquisition-of-stack-overflow-aims-to-turbocharge-the-worlds-software-knowhow/?sh=3dd21ad368ce).  I don't think any of those events are connected, just interesting to see and didn't want you to think he was still at Stack Overflow.).

🎥 [Elegant API Versioning in ASP .NET Core Web API](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iVHtKG0eU_s) I have not vetted these claims, don't @ me. (It being the holidays, please @ me, I'd love to hear from you.)

📝 [The Author of cURL asks the question: "What if Github is the devil?"](https://daniel.haxx.se/blog/2021/01/28/what-if-github-is-the-devil/). This being a serious subject, I will not joke and say "too Late".  

### February 

👐 [Microsoft Open sourced the storage engine that powers Exchange Server, Office 365, and parts of Windows](https://mspoweruser.com/microsoft-open-sources-storage-engine-windows/). They open sourced the Extensible Storage Engine, or ESE for short, and it's been a foundational part of windows since Windows NT 3.51. This is cool and I'm still holding out hope for IIS to be open sourced [so I can finally figure out this 10 year old IIS bug](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7251285/iis-treats-double-encoded-forward-slashes-in-urls-differently-on-the-first-reque).

🔮 [Brent Ozar talks about the future of SQL Server with Forrest Brazeal](https://acloudguru.com/blog/engineering/ozar-whats-the-future-of-microsoft-sql-server). According to Brent, DBAs are safe for at least the next 10 years at least. 

🚨🚨🚨 [Microsoft releases a whitepaper on mitigating risk when using Private package feeds](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/) This dovetails [with the security researcher who wrote about how they hijack'd namespaces for private feeds](https://twitter.com/alxbrsn/status/1359200840876257287?s=20); and Microsoft releases a whitepaper on this issue and how to mitigate this. This is up top because it's crucially important for teams that use private Nuget feeds. [Thanks to Barry "I love Beans" Dorrans for sharing this on Twitter](https://twitter.com/blowdart/status/1359205016016326657).

⚠ [Don't write async validators in ASP.NET Core](https://twitter.com/JeremySkinner/status/1359955978666598404). The Pipeline validators run on is synchronous so you'll run into problems. That's an important safety tip. Thanks Jeremy.

📢 [Dapr 1.0 has been released](https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/02/17/announcing-dapr-v1.0/). Dapr allows you to hot-swap microservice features like queues, data stores, authorization schemes and secrets management. It's a way to write Microservices for the least common denominator. it's like Kubernetes for Tech Stacks... and that's not a compliment.

📝 [Do you need a high performing CSV parser in .NET? Cesil has you covered](https://kevinmontrose.com/2021/02/05/overthinking-csv-with-cesil-source-generators/) and it now supports source generators. Kevin is a really smart guy and he dives deep into how to use source generators for Cesil and what they do. Thanks, Kevin.

📝 [Khalid Abuhakmeh talks about 18 pitfalls you can encounter and EF Core 5 and how to avoid them](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2021/02/24/entity-framework-core-5-pitfalls-to-avoid-and-ideas-to-try) I've hit just about all of these in my work; and that's either an indictment of me or of the framework itself. You choose.

📝 [Blazor Desktop: The Electron for .NET?](https://medium.com/young-coder/blazor-desktop-the-electron-for-net-ecdcf5c30027) by Matthew MacDonald asks this question. It's an interesting way of pitching Blazor that I hadn't considered previously; and I'm excited to see where this goes. We do already have a perfectly good electron, however.

### March

🆘 [Microsoft has realized leaving Nuget to die probably isn't a good idea, and so they're finally paying attention to it](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/state-of-the-nuget-ecosystem/. Nearly every .NET team in existence relies on Nuget, and yet it's received less love than a 12 year old dog at a pound. There are signs that Microsoft wants to change this; and that's a wonderful thing. We'll see what comes of it.

🎉[S4M for .NET](https://philiplaureano.github.io/S4M/) It's a state machine library for .NET, and I'm a big fan of Event Driven Architectures, and when you combine them with State Machines, a whole large swath of both reasoning issues and bugs just go out the window (to be replaced with abusing the state machine; but we can't have everything). I'm going to give this a try and see how it fares. In a "It better do what it says on the tin" moment, S4M stands for "Short, Simple, and Straightforward State Machine Library".

🕷👨‍⚕️[.NET 6 introduced the Priority Queue](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1370376479243132930?s=20) and an enterprising Khalid Abuakumah shows how it works with a nice Avengers example. Black Widow and Dr. Strange are far too down on his list, but other than that it's a pretty good ranking.

📚[Microsoft has Architecture guides for building .NET applications of all sorts](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/dotnet/architecture-guides). And of course, because Microsoft can't do anything without pushing Azure, the guides include how architect those applications in Azure. There's a reason why the Ebooks are free. (Author's note: It's because they consider it a lead-gen for Azure, not because they aren't written well. Realizing some 9 months later that joke was ambiguous).
