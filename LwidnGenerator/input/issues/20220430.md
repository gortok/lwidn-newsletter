It's an abbreviated (and rather late) Last Week in .NET this week, due to a convention and a golf fundraiser on Monday.  Mea culpa, even though I'm really not sorry having a vacation day.

With that behind us, let's get into what happened Last Week in .NET.

[Windows Dev Docs reminds developers about what they need to know for developing Windows Desktop Applications](https://twitter.com/WindowsDocs/status/1518575561479790593), and in a completely not-self-aware moment they don't realize that the sheer need of this document means their strategy is not going to work.  It's slightly better than a flowchart; but gives off the same vibes: If your desktop development strategy, _for a stack you own_, is this complicated, how can you actually expect people to be able to follow it? How can you expect them to _want_ to develop for your platform? The mind boggles.

[Jeff McJunkin says "Your threat model has to allow for attackers gaining local admin-rights"](https://twitter.com/jeffmcjunkin/status/1518738286100901889) to which I reply that none of the alternatives are any better for the developers. There are no 'fully cloud' based development and integration setups that keeps legal from screaming in latin, while also keeping developers happy enough not to leave your company.  Local Admin rights has been a staple of the developer experience for as long as there's been a Windows Operating System (heh.  Does that make the current state of affairs _Microsoft's_ fault?), and VDI or 'thin clients' are terrible for the developer experience. üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[One of the great things about #aspnetcore is that it's really easy to run different frameworks side-by-side](https://twitter.com/JamesNK/status/1518853885942632448) now if only Microsoft would stop eating its young, we might have different web frameworks to run side-by-side. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[Microsoft Build is May 24-26, 2022 and Registration is open](https://mybuild.microsoft.com/en-US/home?OCID=Build2020_TWITTER_windowsdev_spl100003062564760). There is some irony here that people 'have to go back to the office' to have spontaneous collaboration but the conferences are still virtual.  ü§î

[Did you know HTML has the 'inert' attribute](https://twitter.com/jensimmons/status/1519072965421420546)?  If you're building your site to be 'accessible', then you need to know about this element. üí§

[Remote Working has Changed the Rules of the Workplace, so Watch Out](https://www.zdnet.com/article/remote-working-has-changed-the-rules-of-the-workplace-so-watch-out/)
 There's one part to this that makes me happy: Maybe this will be the straw that kills notifications as a viable means to alert people to what's going on. üì¢

[CVE-2022-27774 and CVE-2022-27776 existed in curl release code for 8603 days](https://twitter.com/bagder/status/1519564294702178305).  I will wait patiently while someone explains to me that open-source means that given enough eyeballs, all bugs are shallow. üêõ

[Template Studio is now supported in Visual Studio 2022](https://twitter.com/qmatteoq/status/1519930731853762560).  Template studio 'accelerates the creation of new Apps using a Wizard-based experience'.  This _looks interesting_, but I'll need to dive into it to see if it's more than demo-ware. üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[Hillel Wayne explains the genesis of the Microsoft book, "Mommy, Why is there a Server in the House"](https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1481480665447206912) and for those of you that missed my 40th Birthday, I'll happily take a copy of this book. üìö

And that's all I found last week in .NET. If you've got something to share, you can @ me on twitter @gortok, or email me at George at GeorgeStocker dot com.  We still do this to defeat the bots, right? Right?
