Not too many releases this week but we are swimming in irony. Let's get into why.

[Miguel de Icaza details what it'd take to get Microsoft based X-Plat UIs back into the fight](https://twitter.com/UnoPlatform/status/1559902842290376710), and it doesn't look great, because there is a fight for Cross platform development, and [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) is winning.  Microsoft is hindered by their inability to develop controls for any other platform but their own, and to own the cross-platform developer experience. 🦋

<hr />

In a belated attempt to improve the cross-platform developer experience, [.NET 6 can now be installed natively on ubuntu 22.04](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/dotnet-6-is-now-in-ubuntu-2204/).  This is a great basic step, but the UI is where it's at. The polish of the tooling is where it's at. Being able to more easily install it? Table stakes. 🥩

[Immo Landworth found the most poorly-named Microsoft Product](https://twitter.com/terrajobst/status/1560057085546483713): Microsoft® Visual Studio® 2005 Extensions for Windows Workflow Foundation Beta 1.2 for Microsoft Pre-Release Software WinFX® Runtime Components - December Community Technology Preview (CTP); not to be confused with the worse Microsoft Product, Windows ME. 👆

[Seinfeld talks Kubernetes](https://twitter.com/ianmiell/status/1560244351611162625). You see? I wasn't lying.  You should trust me more. 🙊

<hr />

You can now [deploy your Azure Static Apps to a Named Environment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-gb/azure/static-web-apps/named-environments?tabs=github-actions).  Wait, they didn't have named environments before? 🤷‍♀️

<hr />

[So they got Azure App service moved off of IIS + nginx to YARP](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1560026785944784896). That's pretty impressive. 👍

Meanwhile,  in another corner of Microsoft, [someone is getting a bonus every time you click on a fucking advertisement displayed in your Office toolbar](https://twitter.com/James_M_South/status/1560061124933926912). 🤦‍♂️

<hr />

[Microsoft "Dev Box" is in Preview](https://twitter.com/CloudBoomer/status/1560387316228710401).  I'm sure this is an amazing technical feat, but I'm still not over the fact that in 10 years no one will have control of their own computer any more.  Every computer's OS will be in "the cloud". 👴 🌨

<hr />

[The CFP for .NET Conf is now open](https://twitter.com/dotnet/status/1560395874378956800). Submit your talk today! 🔊

<hr />

On August 25th, the [ABP Framework folks are giving a webinar on ABP](https://twitter.com/dotnetfdn/status/1560623115536945152). Now, I've got opinions about ABP, but they're uninformed opinions, so I need to spin it up before I roast it. 🍠

<hr />

[How to Regain Work-Life Balance in the Age of Hybrid](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/hybrid-work-guides/how-to-regain-work-life-balance-in-the-age-of-hybrid) this is a well written listicle from Microsoft that both advertises its office products and lacks any self-awareness as to how Teams and Outlook detract from work-life balance.  I'm rather impressed at this level of dimness.  If Microsoft really 'work-life balance', they wouldn't have ["presence" settings auto-change when someone is near their computer](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoftteams/presence-admins), and they'd make it non-negotiable that each person can choose their own settings instead of having it chosen for them by their organization. 👉👈

<hr />

And that's it for what happened last week in .NET.

I really should dive deep into the problems with developer tooling in the Microsoft .NET Ecosystem. If that's something that interests you, let me know.
