[Microsoft promises to be all-in on ARM Development](https://twitter.com/kevintgallo/status/1536842216202612741).  Contrary to their promises of UWP, WPF, XNA, and Linq2SQL, they're going to keep it this time.  And in all seriousness, ARM isn't going away; and it's the future, so I do believe they're going to keep this promise. Still, if I'm wrong, [we can always reference this blog post about ARM Development on Windows](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/arm64-visual-studio/ as evidence. üí™

I get flak at times for being persistent in holding Microsoft to account.  "If you don't have something positive to say, don't say anything at all" and all that. But, the lack of forthright discussion about Microsoft's flaws is what got us into the mess [where Azure's Security team talks less than a cop under criminal investigation](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1536866536341655552). If you think I'm being facetious, just remember that we still don't have a full accounting of the ChaosDB incident, and the little they have said [leaves a lot to be desired in the disclosure space](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/08/27/update-on-vulnerability-in-the-azure-cosmos-db-jupyter-notebook-feature/).  What concerns me is that this week's newsletter is going to have more words in it than their supposed accounting of this incident.

What would solve this?

 - A deep dive into the technical part of how this was allowed to happen in the first place. 
 - The extent of their security and logging practices that leaves them confident that this vulnerability didn't go further than they say it did
 - Hiring someone who speaks like a frigging human when they write and doesn't sound like they went to Harvard Law School, graduated with honors and then was accepted into the Washington State Bar, where they practiced and honed their craft of saying absolutely nothing that may have a detrimental effect on their legal liability or accidentally sound like they care about their customers.

Put simply, it appears to the outsiders that Microsoft's Legal department has to OK all their communications, and their legal department airs on the side of extreme caution, to the point that it makes Microsoft seem *less trustworthy* because you know you're not getting the full story.


Also, any time a company [releases a blog post with the word "update" in it, the news is bad](https://twitter.com/gortok/status/1545480153823854593).  ‚öñ

[Ory puts the "security" in enterprise cloud security, and apparently it's easy to use](https://github.com/ory).  I raise awareness for this; not because I think Ory solves that problem (I honestly don't know), but because until we get more eyeballs on these things, we won't know what actually solves the problem.  The problem? Enterprise Identity is still a mess. An unmitigated mess. üîí

Incidentally, I stopped writing Last Week in .NET in part because [I needed time to calm down about the issue of Microsoft once again retreating into closed source territory with .NET](https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1537175065380495367?s=20&t=lhF14HRmPyHC9BOKc0a0dQ).  You see, once you proclaim to the world that you love open source, you're going to have a bad time any time you go against the open source world's interpretation of that statement.  Microsoft could have meant "We love to use Open Source, and we love that people think we're in love with making our stuff open source", and that is indistinguishable from their current actions.

For developer tooling, being Open Source is critical to having acceptance. Every single step that Microsoft takes in the other direction is a step that harms the already fragile .NET ecosystem.

As an aside, I had my suspicions about why Miguel De Icaza left Microsoft, and [this tweet all but confirmed his reasons for leaving: Microsoft is reneging on its open source promises with the Debugger Licensing issues, Hot Reload, and now this](https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1537178691218046976).

[Microsoft Terminal is now integrated with Visual Studio](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1537131655483170817), increasing the number of shells that you can access in Visual Studio to 6. You'd think at some point they'd consolidate, but I'm guessing there are 6 different teams who would be very upset if that happened. 

There's the Package Manager Console, the Visual Studios Tools Command Prompt, the Command Window, the Developer Powershell Window, the Developer Command Prompt, and now the Terminal.  There's also the Immediate Window that is terminal-like. 6Ô∏è‚É£

And that's mostly it for what happened since the last time I published Last Week in .NET.  I am rethinking whether to continue this newsletter, if I'm being honest.  There are plenty of .NET link dropping newsletters, and while I like to think I'm offering something different, if it's not what people *want* then I should spend my time doing something else.  How can I prove this is what people want? More newsletter subscribers.  So use the share URL at the bottom, and let your .NET Team know on slack that this is around. If they like it and I get subscribers, that's a sign I should keep doing it.
