We came off the tail end of a short week, so there are a few good things to read this week. Here's what I found.

<hr />

[The Problem with Fighting Fires](https://www.edbatista.com/2022/06/the-problem-with-fighting-fires.html) You're likely a software developer if you read this newsletter, and so this blog should be at the top of your reading list for today.  Or maybe tattoo it somewhere you can read it daily. üî•

[What are some unanswered questions you have about the WinAppSdk and WinUI](https://twitter.com/thenickrandolph/status/1566991710290583552) Me: Why are they two separate things. Why wouldn't someone who is building an App want a UI? ‚ùì

[Scott Hanselman says upgrade to .NET 6](https://twitter.com/shanselman/status/1566865309029781504) and while in the abstract I agree with him, the sheer problems I've run into even [trying to upgrade .NET Framework projects to use the new SDK style](https://twitter.com/gortok/status/1545066274123878406) (which admittedly is the first step in the process) is nuts.  Write new stuff in .NET 6. Upgrade as you're able; but the list of things that cleanly upgrade is very small. EF doesn't cleanly upgrade, ASP.NET Web API doesn't cleanly upgrade, ASP.NET MVC doesn't cleanly upgrade, and Webforms definitely doesn't cleanly upgrade.  About all that does are class libraries, and that's if you were lucky enough to stay up to date with the changes along the way. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

[Writing Windows Application Services for Kubernetes](https://mikehadlow.com/posts/2022-06-24-writing-dotnet-services-for-kubernetes/) I'm sure this is a great article, but it lost me after this premise: 

> In a traditional .NET distributed application, application services (not to be confused with the Kubernetes ‚Äòservice‚Äô object) would either be written as IIS hosted web applications or Windows Services.

Yea, in 2015 maybe.  If you're writing anything other than Windows Desktop applications today, I highly recommend using .NET 6 and Linux based server runtimes.

At least Mike's advice about avoiding Windows Containers is spot on.  ‚öô

<hr />

[Mads Kristensen walks through what's new in Visual Studio 2022](https://twitter.com/mkristensen/status/1567219973311070208).  I had a recent update that completely screwed the ability of VS 2022 to find the .NET 6 SDK that is installed on my system and reachable from multiple command prompts (no there isn't a global.json in the way).  Sooo while it's much better, there's still the easy slipups in play. üÜï

<hr />

Have you been following the ASP.NET Community standups? [As always there are good tidbits in there](https://twitter.com/DamianEdwards/status/1567235733118922752). ü§º

<hr />

[Developing Error Handling Strategies with asynchronous messaging](https://twitter.com/jeremydmiller/status/1567885324977569794), which is not about how parents with young kids coordinate, but rather about distributed applications. üì§üì•

<hr />

[How Microsoft releases the Azure SDKs](https://twitter.com/alvinashcraft/status/1568219041633894402)   The promise was much better than the result.  Sorry, they can't all be winners.  ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

<hr />

[WebAssembly for .NET Developers: Introducing the Spin .NET SDK](https://www.fermyon.com/blog/webassembly-for-dotnet-developers-spin-sdk-intro). Why do I as a developer want to develop a WASM application?  Tell me in your post.  Tell me why this matters to me.  What will this enable to me? What will be the non-software-building effect?  ‚ùì

<hr />

[Microsoft teams is a terrible product with an amazing social team behind it](https://twitter.com/CrystalMarieCom/status/1568267985428828162) which is so true. Teams is a way for Corporate America to seem like they are cutting edge while reinforcing all of the worst traits of working.  As long as it's pitched to CIOs, it will forever be a step behind and kind of icky when you look closely enough.  üôÉ

<hr />

[Github Copilot is now available for teachers](https://twitter.com/alvinashcraft/status/1568324612554952705)  It bears repeating, but Copilot is code licensing money laundering.  Use it on your codebase with that in mind.  üí∏

<hr />

And that's it for what happened last week in .NET.
