🕸 [WebAssembly Beyond the Browser: Running WASM in .NET Core Applications With WASI & Wasmtime](https://www.thinktecture.com/en/webassembly/with-dotnet/) Anytime someone says something is 'future proof', I wince. The rest of the post is even more out there.

🧵 [A thread of System.Text.Json features in .NET 6](https://twitter.com/okyrylchuk/status/1452737300073525257).  Which is more memorable: "System.Text.Json" or "Newtonsoft"? Hit reply and let me know.

🏫 [Tutorial: Create a minimal API in .NET 6 with Visual Studio](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio).  It's hard not to think that the writing is on the wall for Visual Studio, after all, [these same steps in a VS Code / .NET CLI interface](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/tutorials/min-web-api?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=visual-studio-code) are a lot easier to both take in and do.

🧵 [A thread on WindowsAppSDK Frequently Asked Questions](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1453033223760531458?s=20) Good thread, good info.

🤔 [Covariance & Contravariance in .NET C#](https://levelup.gitconnected.com/covariance-and-contravariance-in-net-c-c2b8576b2155). Co\[|ntra\]variance:  the ultimate compiler "well, actually".

🔓 [Turns out the reporter who 'hacked' the Missouri Government Website, did so by... inspecting ViewState](https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2021/10/viewing-website-html-code-is-not-illegal-or-hacking-prof-tells-missouri-gov/).  'Hacked' of course is in scare quotes; and Viewstate is Base64 encoded.  In 2021 you should already know this, but if you don't: Anything you don't want the user to see should not go in Viewstate.

💥 [Visual Studio 2022 version 17.0 RC3 and Preview 7 ](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2022/release-notes-preview#17.0.0-pre.7.0) Good news, Visual Studio no longer crashes when using Intellisense.

🙊 [Microsft Rankles some by limiting discussion on Cordova shutdown for the AppCenter](https://twitter.com/maxlynch/status/1453121917024718851).  If you're going to retire a technology, at least let people know about alternatives.  Otherwise you reinforce that you aren't there to help the community, you're there to help yourself.

🎨 [Github has a command palette](https://twitter.com/swyx/status/1453401130994520068) (CMD+K on Mac or Ctrl+K on Windows).

👫 [Duende Identity Server (formerly IdentityServce) vs is out](https://mailchi.mp/56601affa6df/october_updates) and it includes BFF support, which does not, I'm told, stand for Best Friend Forever.  I am disappointed.  BFF is "Backend for FrontEnd Support" and it helps you secure SPAs.  

😲 [WindowsAppSDK 1.0 Preview 3 is LIVE](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/releases/tag/v1.0.0-preview3), and [the full release notes are here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/apps/windows-app-sdk/preview-channel#version-10-preview-3-100-preview3), and it's bad when the release notes *start* with the limitations and known issues.

🌠[Did you know there are powershell modules to administer Microsoft products like Teams and Exchange Online](https://msshells.net/)? Now you do.

🙅‍♂️[Developing for Windows with the Windows App SDK](https://github.com/microsoft/WindowsAppSDK/discussions/1615#msdynttrid=9dEOJm2R5tJiJS8AJJPlVp3Hi5xzpDh1HiRZKM7NRd8) The "latest" on what's going on with project reunion. No UWP in .NET 5 or .NET 6. 

🧓[Terminal.Gui 1.31 has been released](https://github.com/migueldeicaza/gui.cs) Get those old-school terminal-user interfaces for your Console application as God intended.

📆 [.NET Conf 2021 is November 9-11, 2021](https://www.dotnetconf.net/). I will livetweet some of it; but a three day virtual conference that spans timezones is a bit much.

🔒[Encrypt/decrypt data with .NET 6 and Azure Key Vault ](https://dev.to/425show/encryptdecrypt-data-with-net-6-and-azure-key-vault-oak), it starts with using Azure; [which at least 69% of you use](https://www.surveymonkey.com/stories/SM-GDSVMB2C/).

👀 And lastly, [I talk about the fundamental problem the .NET Foundation board has](https://georgestocker.com/2021/10/30/the-fundamental-problem-the-net-foundation-board-has/), which dives into the problems plaguing the board and stems from their "Tell me Anything" last week.
