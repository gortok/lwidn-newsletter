### Last Week in .NET - 17 April 2021

[Microsoft Exchange has four new vulnerabilities with patches](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1382016434289704960). CVE-2021-28480, CVE-2021-28481, CVE-2021-28482 and CVE-2021-28483.  For some things the cloud does not make sense, but for the "I really don't want to deal with patching my own stuff", the cloud makes sense.  Maybe it's time to migrate to O365, if you haven't already?

By the way, this is so bad that [the *NSA is actually telling everyone about these flaws immediately*](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nsa-discovers-critical-exchange-server-vulnerabilities-patch-now/).

[Schadenfruede is watching someone else try to set up Microsoft Teams](https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1381704459684831234?s=20) [@mcclure111](https://twitter.com/mcclure111) tries to set up Microsoft Teams to talk to a client, and all hell breaks loose.  It's a fun read if you define fun as "I'm glad that isn't happening to me" and "Holy cow did Microsoft not think through their user experience?"

[Jetbrains ".Net Days" is May 11-12th](https://pages.jetbrains.com/dotnet-days-2021/twitter) and it's free. Scheduled talks include

> "C#, F#, GraphQL, Blazor, gRPC, Hedy, working with databases, and debugging. On top of that, weâ€™ll discuss stereotypes around legacy code and demonstrate how to build a React app backed with Azure features."

And Azure makes an appearance because *of course Azure makes an appearance*.

[Visual Studio 2019 16.10 Preview 2 is out](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2019-v16-10-preview-2/) with lots of .NET goodies included.

[Julia Evans releases her network debugging "Choose Your Own Adventure" game as an early draft](https://twitter.com/b0rk/status/1382383203999219716?s=20).  I played through this and it is wonderful. I highly recommend it.

[Visual Studio 2019 16.9.4 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes#16.9.4) It patches CVE-2021-27064, CVE-2021-28313, CVE-2021-28321, CVE-2021-28322, and patches several upvoted bugs present in Visual Studio.

[EventDriven.EventBus.Dapr 1.0.0 RC 1 has been released](https://github.com/event-driven-dotnet/EventDriven.EventBus.Dapr/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc1) Your weekly note that we use the term "RC" because "Using Customers as our QA" has less zest to it.

[The .NET foundation hosts a project spotlight on "Roslyn"](https://dotnetfoundation.org/projects/spotlight?utm_content=161074607&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-2384354214) which is also Microsoft owned.  Would love a bit more outward focus but Roslyn *is* cool.

[There's a new C# Standard repo that helps to standardize the language used to describe C#](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-open-source-c-standardization-standards/) I don't understand it but perhaps I'm not meant to.  This is about standardizing the language we use to describe the language we use?

[The next version of C# will support building interpolated strings with a... builder based approach](https://twitter.com/terrajobst/status/1381642179123154944?s=20) What does this look like in practice? I have no idea because the authors are more concerned with the structure of the API than showing us what that API would mean with examples.

[Are you planning to migrate from UWP to WinUI 3 Desktop? These are some guidelines that Microsoft is writing.](https://github.com/microsoft/microsoft-ui-xaml/blob/master/docs/winrt-apis-for-desktop.md)  Also Microsoft promises that this is not another "Lucy with the football" moment.

[Andrew Lock writes about Viewing overwritten configuration values in ASP.NET Core](https://andrewlock.net/viewing-overriden-configuration-values-in-aspnetcore/) Environment variables are from 1979, and we still have not come up with a better to deal with this in 2021, but in true tech fashion "you can always write code for it!"

[Instant Feedback Is Here: Introducing Hot Reload in .NET 6](https://www.telerik.com/blogs/instant-feedback-is-here-introducing-hot-reload-in-dotnet-6) Dave Brock from Telerik shows us what Hot Reload is, and how it works in .NET.  And no, this is not an urban dictionary term.


[There's a Root Cause analysis out for CVE-2021-1647](https://googleprojectzero.github.io/0days-in-the-wild//0day-RCAs/2021/CVE-2021-1647.html)  That CVE, just in case you don't have them memorized, was the Windows Defender CVE.  This is a shorter read than the last one I linked to, but still has good information.


[Eric S. Raymond believes that it's easier to tolerate a few jerks than it is to have rules regarding toxicity in a community](https://gcc.gnu.org/pipermail/gcc/2021-April/235575.html) reaffirming the adage that if you look around the table and can't see the jerk, the jerk is you.

[The NSA and US Intelligence Community has affirmatively pinned the Solarwinds attack on Russia's Foreign Intelligence Service, the SVR](https://www.nsa.gov/News-Features/Feature-Stories/Article-View/Article/2573391/russian-foreign-intelligence-service-exploiting-five-publicly-known-vulnerabili/).  When people said "The 80s are back in style" I didn't think they meant the Cold War.

[Announcing Windows 10 Insider Preview Build 21359](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/04/14/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-21359/) Several fixes, previews, and Apparently the Timeline is not going away.  I have no idea what the Timeline is, but it's not going away. Good news?

[The Razor Compiler no longer produces a separate Views Assembly in .NET 6 Preview 3](https://twitter.com/buhakmeh/status/1382757573884055559?s=20)  If this affects you, here's your notice.

[Git is gitting (sorry) better in Visual Studio 16.10 Preview 2](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/enhanced-productivity-with-git-in-visual-studio/).  I've started to try out Git in Visual Studio, and it's not bad.  I still prefer the command line, but that's because I'm a snob.

If you've made it this far you deserve a treat.  [Here's the story as to why He-Man rides a tiger, and I guarantee it'll take you to places you did not expect](https://twitter.com/ponettplus/status/1130876119828316161?s=20)

[Microsoft keeps digging itself into a hole with its MVP Program](https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1382850550761361408) "Astro Turf for SQL Server on Azure" is a helluva strategy.

[Microsoft releases its Hybrid Work Strategy Program](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/worklab/work-trend-index/hybrid-work) It's *only* a decade behind the curve.

[Turns out the Visual Studio logo has a backstory](https://www.mobilize.net/blog/that-visual-studio-logo-its-not-what-you-think-it-is).  

[SQL Server Management Studio 18.9 is out](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sql/ssms/release-notes-ssms?WT.mc_id=twitter-0000-sqldocs&view=sql-server-ver15) Lots of bug fixes and improvements, as always. I used to get on release notes people for writing "Bug fixes and PErformance improvements" but now I realize I can just link to the real release notes and get away with using that term, sooo.

[Show dotnet: Build your own unit test platform? The true story of .NET nanoFramework.](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/show-dotnet-build-your-own-unit-test-platform-the-true-story-of-net-nanoframework/) Sometimes I share things I'm interested in and this is that other time. I'm sure this is cool but I have no idea what it is.

[If you have a Peloton be aware that it eats children](https://twitter.com/film_girl/status/1383469082276614146?s=20). I don't feel the need to go any deeper on that, except to say this is not a euphemism.

[I want AppGet back](https://niemarwinget.medium.com/winget-is-terrible-i-want-appget-back-41b3ca598596). Almost a year ago Microsoft released Winget and people who loved AppGet wish they hadn't. The rest of us are going to wait the requisite 5 years for WinGet to be usable for our day-to-day work.

[NPR talks about the Solarwinds Hack](https://www.npr.org/2021/04/16/985439655/a-worst-nightmare-cyberattack-the-untold-story-of-the-solarwinds-hack).  Reese's make an appearance as do razor blades. 

And that's it for what happened Last Week in .NET.
