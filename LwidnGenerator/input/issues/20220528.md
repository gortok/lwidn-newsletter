[Visual Studio at Microsoft Build 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-at-microsoft-build-2022/). The four biggies are .NET MAUI (Cross platform Desktop Apps -- except WASM, if you want WASM go with UnoPlatform), Microsoft Dev Box (which is a cloud service that has ready-to-roll development environments should a Windows Update bork your dev environment -- which \*never\* happens).  "That's a nice windows environment, it would be a shame if anything happened to it... You know for $1.00 an hour we can give you an environment guaranteed to be available if something should happen..." And the third was Azure Deployment Environments which seems like a lower friction Azure Devops aka Team Foundation Server?  I'm not really sure. If this is your thing send me a note, and lastly is Visual Studio 2022 will run natively on Arm64 and allow you to build and debug Arm64 applications on Arm based devices.
