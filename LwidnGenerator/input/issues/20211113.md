.NET 6 was released last week; .NET 5 has 6 more months of support, and Chrome decides "view source" is bad.

üöÑ[Announcing .NET 6 -- The Fastest .NET yet](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6/) new features include Minimap APIs, Hot Reload for Visual Studio and the .NET CLI, C# 10, better performance, a "Unified platform" for development, and lots, lots more.

üß•[Announcing ASP.NET Core in .NET 6](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-asp-net-core-in-net-6/) Hot Reload makes an appearance, of course, as done Minimal APIs, and lots of improvements for Blazor, and as I said at the top, lots more.  

üíº[The Case for C# and .NET](https://medium.com/@chrlschn/the-case-for-c-and-net-72ee933da304) Charles Chen compares JavaScript and .NET 6, and makes a case for why you should choose C#.

üéÇ[Cake v2.0.0 RC 1 released](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2021/11/cake-v2.0.0-rc0001-released) Lots of bug fixes in this one, and the cake is not a lie. 

üèÉ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è[.NET Everywhere - Windows, Linux, and Beyond](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZM6OO2lkxA4) Scott Hanselman demos .NET across platforms, as the title indicates. It's super weird for Microsoft to have a "Windows Visual Studio only" mentality on one hand and a "but you can run .NET anywhere" mentality on the other.

üö´üõ†[Chrome allows admins to disable "View Source"](https://twitter.com/rakyll/status/1458957329668345864) and this has started a bit of a brouhaha. On one hand, people on the internet are mad that this feature exists, on the other hand people on the internet say it's no big deal.  It's both. You don't improve internet literacy by giving in to companies that put the answers to their exams in the HTML, and you certainly don't lend credence [to the idea that View Source is some sort of crime](https://www.vice.com/en/article/jg8ynp/governor-wants-to-prosecute-journalist-who-clicked-view-source-on-government-site).

üé∏[EF Core 6.0 hops on the minimal API bandwagon](https://twitter.com/okyrylchuk/status/1458203237400649728).  Don't worry, the kitchen sink is still there.

üï∏[Orleans supports .NET 6 with release 3.5.1](https://github.com/dotnet/orleans/releases/tag/v3.5.1) Orleases is Microsoft's approach to 'distributed .NET' on public cloud servers.  It's fascinating (and used by Microsoft) and it now supports .NET 6. No word yet on who outside of Microsoft needs this, however.

‚åö[EF Core 6.0 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/what-is-new/ef-core-6.0/whatsnew). It includes temporal tables, pre-convention configured models, and more.

üßØ[The Hot Reload docs are live](https://twitter.com/LyalinDotCom/status/1457787246371688455). Microsoft is a bit late to this party, so maybe that's why they're all in on the docs? In other stacks, it's just _the way_.

üîÆ[Powershell 7.2 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/powershell/general-availability-of-powershell-7-2) and it includes bug fixes plus predictive intellisense (if you use PSReadLine), which seems pretty neat.

üé≠[Nuget 6.0 has been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/nuget/announcing-nuget-6/) Includes Sourcemapping, Package Vulnarabilities.... wait. Package Vulnerabilities? Oh, it can *show* you package vulnarabilies in Visual Studio.  NuGet is a major part of .NET and is still pretty tightly coupled to Visual Studio.  Until Microsoft fixes that issue, I don't see the claims of '.NET everywhere' coming to fruition.  If you want a first-class experience with Nuget, you're still limited to Visual Studio.

üôä[The EF Core team fixed 545 issues for EF Core 6.0](https://twitter.com/ajcvickers/status/1457802885983453186?s=20).  The [EF Core team is 5 engineers, 1 manager, and a PM](https://twitter.com/ajcvickers/status/1458109389961846790?s=20).   Let's say they started on work for .NET 6 / EF Core 6.0 On January 15th, 2021 (.NET 5 was released in november of last year; but you can imagine they had to work on patches for that, and hopefully took some time off for the holidays).  .NET 6 was released on November 8th, 2021. That means there are 203 work days (excluding weekends and holidays).  With 545 issues fixed, and 5 working members of the team, that's an issue resolved every 2 days per person.  That is a frantic pace; and given what we saw for .NET 5; that means the EF Core team has not had a break in over 2 years from a frantic pace.  Their manager explains this as "passion":

> Or we're just that good. ü§£üòâ (Joke)

> Five engineers, a manager, and a PM. And we mostly just chug along. We don't do heroics. What fits, fits. What doesn't gets punted. That being said, _there's a lot of passion on the team, and it's more than just a job for some of us at least_. (emphasis mine)

I have to say I'm a bit concerned about the work/life balance for the EF team, and it raises a whole lot of red flags to see this sort of pace for the last 18 months.

üê¶[Jeremy Sinclair livetweets the .NET 6 release](https://twitter.com/sinclairinat0r/status/1458102889528836103?s=20) .NET 6.  Now .NET 6 is the LTS version of .NET that finally sheds the Framework mantle (.NET 5 wasn't LTS), and so you should see .NET 6 as the first major .NET Version that legacy companies migrate to.

‚Åâ[Steve shows off implicit global usings](https://twitter.com/stevejgordon/status/147707447716622336) One of the major problems I've had with code samples on the internet is the namespaces not being included in the code sample.  This makes that worse, and easier to happen.  I like the idea, but the implementation doesn't help our current set of problems with getting code off the internet.

üö¢[NativeAOT coming in .NET 7](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/61231) This will allow for a statically linked 'single file' deployment to all platforms, a la Go.

üß•[Full-stack .NET 6 Apps with Blazor WebAssembly and Azure Static Web Apps](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/apps-on-azure/full-stack-net-6-apps-with-blazor-webassembly-and-azure-static/ba-p/2933428)  Since Blazor can support WebAssembly, and Static web apps are just that; you can now deploy Blazor apps to Azure Static Web Apps. I'm interested to see what sort of frameworks around Blazor pop up.

üí∏[CSharpFritz (Jeff Fritz) plays Pitchman for Mobile.NET's product that convert's Webforms to "Native Web App"](https://twitter.com/dotnetfdn/status/1458502718679654410).  This is interesting inasfar as Jeff works for Microsoft on the .NET team, and Mobilize.NET (as far as I know) is a third-party vendor -- why is Microsoft pitching other companies' products?

üìπ[Visual Studio 2022 has been released](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f8jXO946eDw) and Scott Hanselmen (and friends) take you through what's new. There's [also a blog post if you aren't the 'watching videos on the internet' type](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/visual-studio-2022-now-available/).

‚è≥[You have 6 months before .NET 5 is End of Life](https://twitter.com/blowdart/status/1457819844858945537) and [you can read Microsoft's support policy here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/support/policy).

It was a busy week last week with the release of .NET 6; and hopefully the folks at Microsoft are going to take a bit of extra time off for Thanksgiving. See you all next week.
