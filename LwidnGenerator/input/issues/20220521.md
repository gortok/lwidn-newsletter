Let's see, `ref` optimizations, stories about migrating to C#, and... cryware.  Let's get into what happened last week in .NET.


[The journey of moving from C++/WinRT to C# in the Microsoft Store](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/ifdef-windows/the-journey-of-moving-from-cpp-winrt-to-csharp-in-the-microsoft-store/) The Windows Store is written in C#, and there's a bit of an interesting story behind the move from C++ and WinRT to C#.  The fact that it uses C# is probably the most popular thing about the Windows Store. 🏔

[Satya Nadella announces a plan to increase employee pay through merit increases and stock grants, starting September 1st](https://twitter.com/ashannstew/status/1526250719338061824)  Microsoft wants to pay its employees more so it doesn't lose them.  Good. Now the stock grants at the moment aren't worth as much as they otherwise might be (but that perception may be affected by the recency bias), but every little bit helps. 💸

[Miguel de Icaza tweets a bit of color](https://twitter.com/migueldeicaza/status/1526267173454356480) when referring [to a blog post about Flutter](https://redmonk.com/jgovernor/2022/05/16/flutter-propels-dart-frameworks-language-adoption-and-cross-platform-development/), and it's rather good:

> Flutter early on paid a heavy price to render every widget, which both React, Forms/Maui avoided; but in the long term this paid off very nicely.
>
> For a large class of apps, consistency across platforms and ease of development is more important than native controls

[@JaredPar (Jared Parsons, member of the Roslyn compiler team) explains why utf8 string literals require the `u8` postfix](https://twitter.com/jaredpar/status/1526250917254664192).  I'm grateful this work is being done in the open, I just wish there was a better way annotate that it was UTF-8.  A postfix (suffix) keyword seems... un-C#-ish. 🪕

[More code samples for #WinUI in the #WindowsStore on #Github are available](https://twitter.com/WindowsDocs/status/1526971342683242497) I'm gonna go out on a limb and say that they're overdoing the hashtags for 'engagement' on the @WindowsDocs twitter account. #ffs #️⃣
