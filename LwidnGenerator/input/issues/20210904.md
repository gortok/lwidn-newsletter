Last Week in .NET - Week ending 6 September 2021

üë∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [Working with Nuget Local Packages](https://www.codemag.com/Article/2109091/Working-with-NuGet-Local-Packages) An up to date look at how to publish nuget packages locally. 

ü§ñüß† [Plan for Deep Learning in .NET](https://github.com/dotnet/machinelearning/issues/5918) The Machine Learning team at Micorosoft has published their plan for Deep Learning in .NET; and in case you don't know the difference between Deep Learning and Machine Learning, I looked it up and the difference is 'fuckall'. In all seriousness it looks like the difference is that the Deep Learning folks want AI to make its own decisions, instead of using human provided data to make decisions.

‚¨á[Download New Azure Architecture Icons now!](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/07/download-new-azure-architecture-icons-now/) These icons look rather spiffy but you know some executive at Microsoft wanted the name 'Azure' somewhere on these icons.

1Ô∏è‚É£1Ô∏è‚É£[Microsoft announces Windows 11 will release on October 5 for new and existing PCs](https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-11-october-5-launch-date), and in other news [they've added about 10 CPUs from the 7XXX series Intel CPUs, AKA "Intel 7th-generation Core" chips](https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-11-intel-7th-gen-cpu-compatibility-announcement).  If there wasn't a pandemic and a world-wide shortage of chips, I wouldn't be so ticked at Microsoft for requiring a CPU from 2018 or later. 

üò∑ [TechBash 2021 has been postponed](https://techbash.com/blog/2021/09/01/techbash-2021-postponed) If you want some semblance of normal: Get vaccinated if you can.  Otherwise we're likely to hear this same tune in 2022 as well.

2Ô∏è‚É£2Ô∏è‚É£[There's a Microsoft Event on September 22nd at 11am ET](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/event). I'll be live tweeting this [(@gortok on twitter)](https://twitter.com/gortok/).

üö® [US CYBERCOM releases a cybersecurity alert about Atlassian Confluence CVE-2021-26084](https://twitter.com/CNMF_CyberAlert/status/1433787671785185283) and this CVE is bad enough for the US Fricking Government to use twitter to provide immediately and timely advice.  If you use Atlassian Confluence on-prem, you want to patch immediately.

All in all a pretty light week; with Labor Day around the corner it's expected that next week will also be pretty light.
