Github's COO exits a month after their CEO left, Github gives a 'status update' to their availability over the past month, and the battle over Microsoft's image is being waged internally.

[Anti-Patterns when Building Container Images](http://jpetazzo.github.io/2021/11/30/docker-build-container-images-antipatterns/)  There are a lot of little paper-cuts when using container images (docker images, the Xerox of Containers), especially if you want to host your database in a container image.  So, read this and file it away for when you invariably run into a problem. 

[Uno aka "MAUI that's available right now" 4.0 has been released](https://platform.uno/blog/announcing-uno-platform-4-0-four-major-components-added/) If you want cross-platform .NET UIs, you want to use Uno. They're not a sponsor, but their business is cross-platform UIs, and Microsoft is still stuck in the 90s image of Microsoft being Windows only, more on that in a minute.

[Cake 2.0.0 has been released](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2021/11/cake-v2.0.0-released) Last week they released Cake 2.0.0rc0002, and the number of leading zeros on the RC had me a bit worried, but not to fear, they've just said f\*ck it and released Cake 2.0.  There are a ton of breaking changes (not what you want to hear) and feature improvements, particularly around supporting .NET 6. No one really wants to upgrade their build tooling, but they do want their build tooling to support their framework up-to-date. 

[Rider 2021.3 goes Beta](https://blog.jetbrains.com/dotnet/2021/12/01/rider-2021-3-goes-beta/) The Debug UI gets a new 'fit (that's what the kids say, right?), and it supports more C# 10 features, like file-scoped namespaces (Which felt like it should have been in C# 1.0), and global usings (which I maintain shouldn't exist) and string handling changes as well as lambda changes for C# 10.

[Github Availability Report: November 2021](https://github.blog/2021-12-01-github-availability-report-november-2021/) You know Github has fully integrated into Microsoft when their blog post titles about bad news are a milquetoast as possible.  In this case, Github was down on November 27th, for almost 3 hours. I can hear you saying this now, "That's unfair, George", but if we go back to Scott Sander's release in 2016 from a similar issue (Github was down for 2 hours and 6 minutes that time), Scott starts out by saying:

> Last week GitHub was unavailable for two hours and six minutes. We understand how much you rely on GitHub and consider the availability of our service one of the core features we offer. Over the last eight years we have made considerable progress towards ensuring that you can depend on GitHub to be there for you and for developers worldwide, but a week ago we failed to maintain the level of uptime you rightfully expect. We are deeply sorry for this, and would like to share with you the events that took place and the steps we’re taking to ensure you’re able to access GitHub.

Contrast this with the first paragraph of the November 27th 2021 outage:

> In November, we experienced one incident resulting in significant impact and degraded state of availability for core GitHub services, including GitHub Actions, API Requests, Codespaces, Git Operations, Issues, GitHub Packages, GitHub Pages, Pull Requests, and Webhooks.
