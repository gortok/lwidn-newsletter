Here we go, again.

On October 19th, the PM For "Hot Reload" (which honestly sounds like an urban dictionary term of art), [showed off Hot Reload to internal stakeholders](https://twitter.com/LyalinDotCom/status/1450487382491361281).  On October 20th, [Hot Reload was removed from the .NET 6 RC2 CLI in favor of a Visual Studio only release](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/update-on-net-hot-reload-progress-and-visual-studio-2022-highlights/).  On October 22nd, the news broke in [the Register](https://www.theregister.com/2021/10/22/microsoft_net_hot_reload_visual_studio/) and [the Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/22/22740701/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-removal-decision-open-source), with the Verge stating the reasoning was a "business-led decision" by the CVP of Developer Division (DevDiv), Julia Luison. On October 23rd, Microsoft put it back in [saying "we inadvertently ended up deleting the source code instead of just not invoking that code path"](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-hot-reload-support-via-cli/), [and it was also reported by The Verge](https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/23/22742282/microsoft-dotnet-hot-reload-u-turn-response).

Since then, [an internal communication has leaked with the DevDiv rank-and-file up in arms about the decision](https://pastebin.com/RF6015kv).

There is ample evidence to draw conclusions that this was not inadvertant, and that [Scott Hunter's blog post](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-hot-reload-support-via-cli/) is to maintain political cover for the CVP that made the decision:

1. If this were 'inadvertant', then [there would have been no reason to close and lock the PR to prevent discussion](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/pull/22217).
2. If this were 'inadvertant', then the myriad of developers that make up .NET's online twitter presence wouldn't have been radio silent on the subject *for days*.
3. If this were 'inadvertant', then someone from the .NET team would have spoken up to explain what the reasoning was behind [*removing a working feature from a Release Candidate*](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/22247)

I could go on. But unfortunately if I point to the back-channel ways the .NET Team was trying to show that it wasn't their call, I would get them in trouble with their corporate overlords.

The .NET Community [was largely pissed off](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/22247) (a technical term) at the removal of this working feature from the .NET CLI and making it 'Visual Studio only', and I can't say I blame them.

The problem here is the same problem the .NET Community has with the .NET foundation's governance:  Microsoft.

One the one hand, Microsoft would like to be known as a steward of open source; going so far as to showing ["We â™¥ Open Source"](https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/15/12926288/microsoft-really-does-love-linux), but on the other, each time it comes down to making a hard decision that would benefit the open source community but *potentially* harm Microsoft's business interests, it chooses its business interests, *every time*.

It [happened with the Debugger License Change](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/505).

It [happened with MonoDevelop](https://blog.lextudio.com/the-end-of-monodevelop-80b383dab34b).

It [happened with Hot Reload](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/22247).

This is a pattern of corporate interests at Microsoft wanting to lock down development ecosystems to enhance their product's bottom line while hurting adoption that ends up hurting *Azure's bottom line*.

And that's the rub.  Visual Studio is great -- I personally love it, but I also love not having to boot into Windows to write .NET.  .NET Core saved me from leaving .NET. Seriously.  I like a console-first workflow, and the developer affordances in a \*nix based environment outweigh any improvements Microsoft has made, and I go so far as to say that a console-first workflow *respects how I work*.  

So that's how Microsoft shat the bed last week in .NET.  Let's see what else happened.
