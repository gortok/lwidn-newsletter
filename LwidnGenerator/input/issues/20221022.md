I would like .NET Development (Desktop, API, and Web) to be as easy as it is to launch a web application with Django or Rails.  I would love for a productive .NET ecosystem that rewards non-Microsoft based products.   We get to dive into a little bit of why those things are impossible right now, let's get to it.

[Did you know there's a roadmap for WPF?](https://github.com/dotnet/wpf/blob/main/roadmap.md) They cover Winforms too, in a "The decor says 90s but we can't bear tearing down the house" sort of way. 🗺

[How to build a cloud native application with AWS and .NET](https://twitter.com/resharper/status/1577294970108747776) is one of the talks at JetBrain's .NET Days Online on October 26th, 2022.  I appreciate the realization that with the marketshare disparity between AWS and Azure that they're not trying to make Fetch happen here. 🐕

[Announcing Windows 11 Insider Preview Build 25227](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2022/10/19/announcing-windows-11-insider-preview-build-25227/) This preview build includes changes to the Widgets location as Microsoft's windows product time tries to find the least terrible location for something that there is mixed data at best that people actually use them. 🗺

[Microsoft blames security researcher for publicizing data breach](https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2022/10/19/investigation-regarding-misconfigured-microsoft-storage-location-2/), says it's overstated and refuses to answers questions about the breadth of the breach [in its support tickets](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1582819993263099905) I appreciate [Corey Quinn's take on this](https://twitter.com/QuinnyPig/status/1583143233248378880), and overall it's embarassing to see this sort of response from Microsoft and most certainly an unforced error on their part.  If you leave an API endpoint open and people take the data, you're the problem, not anyone else. 🐑 🐟

[Cory Doctorow writes a treatise (or a tweetise, or a twitter thread if you're boring) on the problems with Tech today](https://twitter.com/doctorow/status/1583143915607060481).  Shorter Doctorow: It no longer seeks to make our lives better; it has the same problems as American Capitalism: Scale and eyeballs over function and humanity. 💸

[The Azure Devops podcast talks about Windows SDK](https://twitter.com/ClearMeasure/status/1583155861639217152).  I don't *think* this podcast was originally named the Team Foundation Server podcast; but I'm willing to be wrong. Interestingly this does not look like a Microsoft property; I'm somewhat surprised the podcast host hasn't been hit with a trademark infringement cease and desist letter. 🪟

[Hillel Wayne shares the most controversial opinion he holds regarding software quality: Get a Good Night's Sleep](https://twitter.com/hillelogram/status/1119709859979714560). At the tender age of 40 I spent all weekend volunteering from before dawn to dusk both days and am absolutely dragging even two days later.  Sleep is super important (no shit, right?) 😴

[As you read this, .NET Days Online is tomorrow](https://twitter.com/fbouteruche/status/1584487322078543875).  Better that than .NET Daze Online, amirite?  Ok, that was a terrible joke.  They can't all be winners. 🎈

And that's it for what happened Last Week in .NET.
