### Last Week in .NET - July 3, 2021

I swore up and down I would not release a newsletter this week owing to the July 4th holiday (Treason day for the Brits out there), and then Microsoft's Github [announced and released Github Copilot](https://github.blog/2021-06-29-introducing-github-copilot-ai-pair-programmer/), and my promise fell apart.

CoPilot is an ML trained code snippet generator.  What is it trained on, you ask?  All the public code on Github, GPL'd or otherwise.  This has angered the internet lawyers and is generally considered to be a Dick Move™ by everyone else (except those that have read the parable of [the Scorpion and the Frog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scorpion_and_the_Frog)). And since there really isn't any magic in ML, that's led to some interesting bugs... like [reproducing the inverse-sine function from Quake](https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1410886329924194309) to include the PG-13 rated comments.  Or [giving internet randos the API keys that Sendgrid users put in their source code on accident](https://twitter.com/alexjc/status/1411966249437995010), or [even reproducing the GPL in its entirety in a source code header file](https://docs.github.com/en/github/copilot/research-recitation) and none of this includes [the mundane but possibly Office Space plot inducing every day bugs present in CoPilot](https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/1410399693025153028?s=20).

It's almost trite to call these 'bugs', these aren't bugs.  These aren't misunderstandings of product requirements, or bad coding.  No, these are Ian Malcoms: 

> Your <strike>scientists</strike> engineers were so preoccupied with whether or not they could, they didn’t stop to think if they should. ([original source](https://quotegeek.com/quotes-from-movies/jurassic-park/397/))

AI and ML have given us a new class of software defect: the Ian Malcom, and we can thank Github for playing the role of movie villian here.

With that out of the way, here's what else happened last week in .NET.

[In Windows 11 you can now specify which Terminal you want to use](https://twitter.com/ow/status/1409625508287893506) and not have to have cmd.exe launch all the time.  I don't want to be cruel; but would anyone willingly choose cmd.exe as their terminal? @ me if you would, and why.

[ZDNet's Jason Berlow says he'll bite the bullet and buy a new PC for Windows 11](https://www.zdnet.com/article/ok-microsoft-you-win-im-buying-a-windows-11-pc/) and it's important to note that 'more secure' here means "less likely to get taken down by ransomware". Microsoft's usual track record for security post-boot-up still applies.

Adam Storr has a blog post out titled [Test Your .NET HttpClient Based Strongly Typed Clients Like a Boss](https://adamstorr.azurewebsites.net/blog/test-your-dotnet-httpclient-based-strongly-typed-clients-like-a-boss), and I'm not clear from the title if he means the every day "exploit them" or if there's a more sinister meaning, like "gaslight them into believing working 60 hours a week means you're a team player".

There was a [LinkedIn Breach](https://9to5mac.com/2021/06/29/linkedin-breach/) announced on June 29th, with the field "Inferred Salary" included.  Since no one knows what "inferred" means here, we'll just go with the face-value interpretation that LinkedIn calculates what your salary should be based on your experience and roles and local market and that is exactly why naming is so important in software.

I got a little flak last week for suggesting that Azure Static Web Apps were mundane but being touted as The Next Great Invention After Sliced Bread, and [here's just another example](https://twitter.com/TechieLass/status/1402898591790817285?s=20).  Now, I *get* that if you work at Azure, you should be touting Azure products -- but my concern here is that treating something mundane like Static site hosting as revolutionary in your verbiage (*awesome*, is it really awe inspiring?)
