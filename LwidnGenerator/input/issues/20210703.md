### Last Week in .NET - July 3, 2021

I swore up and down I would not release a newsletter this week owing to the July 4th holiday (Treason day for the Brits out there), and then Microsoft announced and released Github Copilot, and my promise fell apart.

CoPilot is an ML trained code snippet generator.  What is it trained on, you ask?  All the public code on Github. GPL'd or otherwise.  This has angered the internet lawyers and is generally considered to be a Dick Move™ by everyone else. And since there really isn't any magic in ML, that's led to some interesting bugs... like [reproducing the inverse-sine function from Quake](https://twitter.com/mitsuhiko/status/1410886329924194309) to include the PG-13 rated comments.  Or [giving internet randos the API keys that Sendgrid users put in their source code on accident](https://twitter.com/alexjc/status/1411966249437995010) and none of this includes [the mundane but possibly Office Space plot inducing every day bugs present in CoPilot](https://twitter.com/asmeurer/status/1410399693025153028?s=20).

It's almost trite to call these 'bugs', these aren't bugs.  These aren't misunderstandings of product requirements, or bad coding.  No, these are Ian Malcoms:

AI and ML have given us a new class of software defect; the Ian Malcom, and we can thank Github for playing the role of movie villian here.
