### Last Week in .NET - Week Ending 26 June 2021

‚ò† [Barry "I love tormenting people with pictures of beans" Dorrans reminds all of us that .NET Core 2.1 is End of Life at the end of August](https://twitter.com/blowdart/status/1407002562641883139?s=20). I'm impressed support for .NET Core 2.1 lasted this long.

üöú[R# and JetBrains Rider will support "Create from usage" for C# Records](https://twitter.com/controlflow/status/1406920589177147393?s=20), which is pretty neat if you ask me.

‚ö° [Let's Learn .NET - Blazor" free Livestream happened June 25th](https://dev.to/dotnet/let-s-learn-net-blazor-free-live-stream-event-5afd) so if you want to learn Blazor, this is your chance to catch up on the video.

üèõ [David Fowler And Damien Edwards talk about ASP.NET Core's Architecture (Part 3) in this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTpxQFXxKPs).  This is a very informative series, and I'm looking forward to watching the recap.

üí∞ [.NET Nanoframework received $10,000 (USD) from the Microsoft FOSS Fund](https://twitter.com/nanoFramework/status/1406932013760847875).  This was from a vote held by Microsoft Employees that work on FOSS projects. 

üì¢ [Releasing Windows 10 Build 19042.1081 (20H2) to the Release Preview Channel](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/17/releasing-windows-10-build-19042-1081-20h2-to-release-preview-channel/) and it's clear that no one ever speaks these blog titles out loud.  They could at least name them funny names. 

üì¢ [Remote Desktop Connection Manager v2.81 has been released](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/rdcman) and there are no release notes so I just have to assume everything listed is what's new. It seems... packed.

2Ô∏è‚É£ [Blazorday happened on 17 June 2021](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t_UyOXydnsQ) and I can only find one video so I have to assume this one is it. 

ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/events/learntv/swa-cts-june-2021/?WT.mc_ID=swa-124587-memckenn](https://twitter.com/burkeholland/status/1407399403846000645?s=20) The amount of press this event has gotten leads me to believe this is something more exciting than static web hosting launching, so I have to assume it's something more than that.

‚ô•‚ô¶‚ô†‚ô£Exception Not Found (the blog, not the exception) has a Part 3 to their blog post [Solitaire in Blazor, Part 3 - Drawing, Discarding, and the Stacks](https://exceptionnotfound.net/solitaire-in-blazor-part-3-drawing-discarding-and-the-stacks/) I'm loving this approach to teaching blazor.

‚öî[Attack Surface Analyzer is open source](https://github.com/microsoft/AttackSurfaceAnalyzer) and I'm mentioning this because [Barry "I wish I had married Beans" Dorrans](https://twitter.com/blowdart/status/1407472920977309696?s=20) did not realize it was open source and so it's news to at least two of us on the internet.

üé© [Microsoft is now a $2 trillion dollar company](https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1407425193874792449?s=20) and there is positively no excuse for them to need ICE's money at this point.

üìÜ [The .NET Oracle Team is looking to release ODP.NET support for EF Core 6 'by the end of 2021'](https://medium.com/@alex.keh/oracle-support-for-net-6-and-entity-framework-core-6-statement-of-direction-cfa5d1c59ff8).

üè™ [The Microsoft Store now supports PWA, Win32, and UWP and oh yea, Developers can use their own commerce engines and keep their profits](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1408086587745972224?s=20)  This is one way to get people to adopt the Microsoft store, although I have a sinking feeling if it does get adoption, this will change.

üé≤ [XBox Game Pass will be built into Windows 11](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1408085453044170757?s=20) and I have no idea what XBox Game Pass is because I have three kids and no time to game.

üôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è In what I consider a kindness, Kevin Gallo blogs about [What Windows 11 means for developers](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/06/24/what-windows-11-means-for-developers/), my thanks to Kevin.

‚èØ The [Windows 11 Livestream is available for replay](https://twitter.com/Windows/status/1407832337656606723?s=20) in case you missed it. I did.

üìù [Project Reunion has been 'renamed' to Windows App SDK](https://twitter.com/gcaughey/status/1408092319090417665?s=20) and this is quite possibly the least Microsoft Name it could have been given. It's clear the marketing team was not involved in the naming of this, and we are all the better for it.

üßØIf you enjoy gambling and want to try out Windows 11 Insider Preview, [Here's a handy blog post that will take you back to Windows 10 if and when you hate it](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/06/24/preparing-for-insider-preview-builds-of-windows-11/).

ü§ºIt's Official, [Windows 11 Is just a reskinned OSX... 11.](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2021/06/24/introducing-windows-11/)  

‚è©[Ok fine so it's not really a reskin, apparently](https://twitter.com/unixterminal/status/1408097059702444045?s=20), as updates are 40% smalle and happen in the background, so something is going on under the hood.

üòûWant to see if your PC can be upgraded to Windows 11? [Use this tooland prepare for disappointment](https://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2021/06/windows-11-compatibility-check.html)

üëç And [No, .NET 6 will not be bundled with Windows 11 because that's a terrible idea](https://github.com/dotnet/core/issues/6411)

[.NET 6 Preview 5 is now on Azure App Service](https://azure.github.io/AppService/2021/06/25/Dot-Net-6-Preview-5-on-App-Service.html) and Byron is clearly not following Microsoft's Marketing KPIs because Azure appears no where in the blog post title.

And that's it for what happened in .NET.  This coming weekend is a holiday weekend; so there will be no Last Week in .NET Next week, and I'm starting to regret the title.
