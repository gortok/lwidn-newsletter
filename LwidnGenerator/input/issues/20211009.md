Two years of simmering discord came to a head last week as the .NET OSS maintainers openly revolted against the .NET Foundation for years of non-communication, the Executive Director resigned, and newly elected board members are left to pick up the pieces.

It was a wild week.

First, there was some discord [due to the .NET Foundation saying a board member left 'for personal reasons'](https://dotnetfoundation.org/blog/2021/09/22/net-foundation-election-results-2021) when in reality they left [due to the nature of the .NET Foundation itself](https://rodneylittlesii.com/posts/topic/foundation-echo-chamber).

Second, *during* this brouhaha and [when finding out the Executive Director merged a PR without communicating](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/38), the .NET community learned that their projects were moved to the Foundation's Github Enterprise account without their consent, that [the DNFAdmin service account was basically a trojan horse](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/38#discussioncomment-1432691) (an actual Trojan Horse, not the virus variety),  and that even if they signed the 'contributor model' contracts, [they may not own their own projects](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/39#discussioncomment-1441867).

As I said, it was a wild week.

So, the Executive Director apologized, not for the lack of communication, or moving the projects to the .NET Foundation's Github Enterprise account, or misstating why Rodney Littles II left the board, or for the fact that the foundation has not been up front with what it means to have a project join the .NET Foundation, but for... [forcing through a PR on a project that the foundation ostensibly owned](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/39).

Naturally [members of the community asked for the Executive Director's resignation, and they got it](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/40).  And we sit, a few days later, [watching more communication from a single member of the board](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions) than we had from entire previous Boards of Directors, particularly around most of the painpoints the community mentioned previously.

And since I'm writing this newsletter, I get to have my say.

I don't think Claire Novotny should have resigned as the Executive Director of the .NET Foundation.  I believe her to be a scapegoat for the structural issues the .NET Foundation has, as [I've written about](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/49#discussioncomment-1454878) and [spoken about previously](https://podcast.lastweekin.net/4).  We've had entire Boards of Directors come and go from the .NET foundation with nary a peep from them in public about their work, no after-action review or postmortem, nothing outside of their initial interview to become a member of the Board of Directors.

I believe if anyone should resign, it *should be* the Boards of Directors. They ultimately are responsible for what the Executive Director and what the .NET Foundation does, and while half the board is fresher than a prince from Bel-air, the other half aren't, and in some form of irony, it's only the new people who are speaking out.  I think they're Good People, but they either have no idea what they're doing or they haven't seen and felt the issue simmering for the last few years, in which case they most assuredly shouldn't be representing the community in the .NET Foundation.

It really all comes back to a single question: _What does the .NET Foundation do?_  or, taken further: _Why does the .NET Foundation exist?_.  We haven't really gotten an answer to that question yet; especially the vague "commercially friendly" mission statement. 

I'm willing to bet the Board of Directors haven't been taking minutes for their daily meetings over the past week, [even though the bylaws require them to](https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/bylaws), and so I've taken to asking that the [bylaws be amended to require that the minutes are shared for review by the membership of the foundation](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/56).

If the .NET foundation is going to exist, then it's going to have a vision and a purpose. If you care about .NET and the future of .NET, you should be right there, holding their feet to the fire. Otherwise we're going to get what we've always got, a mono-culture that seeks to fulfill Microsoft's whims about .NET; not what the actual OSS community wants or needs of .NET.

With that bit of news in the can, let's see what else happened Last Week in .NET:
