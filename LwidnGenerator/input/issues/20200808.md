### .NET Core fails to build from source:

[https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/11795](https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/11795) - This was both frightening and "I did not know that" moment. If there are security vulnerabilities; the nightly won't build. If an internal package is removed, nightlies won't build.

.NET Conf "Focus on Microservices" Playlist now on youtube.

Pretty cool from an engineering perspective, but doesn't actually solve a problem people launching Microservices have (If you really want to change your data-store on the fly from SQL to No-SQL, reach out.

### Microsoft let's employees sponsor open source projects at $10,00 a piece.

[https://github.com/microsoft-sponsorships/microsoft-foss-fund/blob/main/README.md](https://github.com/microsoft-sponsorships/microsoft-foss-fund/blob/main/README.md) This is nice of Microsoft; they let their employees vote on FOSS projects to give $10,000 to, and then the three top projects chosen get $10,000.

I guess that means Microsoft *can* pay for OSS when they want to.

Shout out to Jeff Wilcox for the Tweet letting me know about this.

### Microsoft's Ignite - September 22-24 2020

It's online this year, and they're calling it a digital event experience. The jokes right themselves. Can't we just say "It's an online conference"? Anyway, since there's not a whole heck of a lot to do

### PFCLofW (pretty fricking cool library of the week)

[Storyteller](https://storyteller.github.io/) is a library that lets you write markdown to specify your system; and then turns those into executable tests. I know, I know, customer written tests are snake-oil. They have been and always will be; Now if you could specify your tests in excel? That might be the ticket. Still, this is a cool library to check out, even if only from an engineering perspective.
