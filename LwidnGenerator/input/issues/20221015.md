Releases, CVEs, and a look into The Last Of Us's Breathing System as a programming marvel. Let's get into it.

[.NET Core 3.1.30](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.30/3.1.30.md), [.NET 6.0.10](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.10/6.0.10.md) and .NET 7 RC 2 are out.  On the .NET 3.1 and .NET 6 side, they're patching a privilege escalation CVE ([CVE-2022-41032](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41032)), interestingly enough this also affects NuGet.  As security releases too often are, this one is mum on the details because there's no way that showing users how vulnerabilities work is a good thing.  It's best if that's kept to as few eyes as possible, because if people were to be educated, what would happen? Chaos.  [They also list a CVE fix for .NET 7 RC2](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/7.0/preview/7.0.0-rc.2.md), but they don't list the same CVE, even though they copied and pasted the text from one release announcement to the other.   Apparently that CVE for .NET 7 RC 2 that's fixed is CVE-2022-38013 (though again, I wonder if that isn't a transposition error). üè¥

[The Breathing System in Last Of us shows off how programming is (as Jeff Atwood put it) getting millions of tiny details right](https://threadreaderapp.com/thread/1284544387616104448.html).  You never think of breathing being complicated, after all, you're doing it right now.  But try to program it, and suddenly a whole bunch of little details have to be figured out.  This is a great thread showing the wonder of modern game programming.  [Don't forget part 2](https://twitter.com/thebeauanthony/status/1284544453709934592). ‚úå

[Marten and Friends Hopefully Big Future](https://jeremydmiller.com/2022/10/10/marten-and-friends-hopefully-big-future/) So Marten is a DocumentDB built on top of Postgresql; and Jasper (now rebranded as Wolverine) is a Message Bus for .NET.  Long story short is that they're working on commercializing and improving the story behind .NET CQRS/Event Sorucing/Distributed Frameworks; and I'm here for it.  On the one side you have the extremely buttoned-up and corporate Orleans or Dapr, and on the other hand you have the people who make this an non-monolithic ecosystem. üöß

With the new .NET 7 RC 2 release [there were updates to ASP.NET Core](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/asp-net-core-updates-in-dotnet-7-rc-2/) including caching improvements and authentication diagnostics with Blazor and WebAssembly. üÜï

[Terminal.Gui](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=33190257) made the front page of the Orange Site, and it's nice to see C# get some love. Special thanks to [@ckindel for the mention](https://twitter.com/ckindel/status/1580576024844152833). üëè

And finally, Jeremy Sinclair has a twitter thread on source generated Regex improvements (that's a lot to type) in .NET 7](https://twitter.com/sinclairinat0r/status/1580611604441272321) worthy your time to read. Do you want to make Regexes fast? Now you only have two problems. (Also, it's pronounced regex, not regex). ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

And that's it for what I found last week in .NET.  If you like internet shout-outs or sharing your favorite .NET (or let's be real, Microsoft) content, send it my way [@gortok on twitter](https://twitter.com/gortok), or if you're getting this through email, hit reply.  See you next week.
