[.NET Core 3.1.30](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/3.1/3.1.30/3.1.30.md), [.NET 6.0.10](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/6.0.10/6.0.10.md) and .NET 7 RC 2 are out.  On the .NET 3.1 and .NET 6 side, they're patching a privilege escalation CVE ([CVE-2022-41032](https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/en-US/vulnerability/CVE-2022-41032)), interestingly enough this also affects NuGet.  As security releases too often are, this one is mum on the details because there's no way that showing users how vulnerabilities work is a good thing.  It's best if that's kept to as few eyes as possible, because if people were to be educated, what would happen? Chaos.  [They also list a CVE fix for .NET 7 RC2](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/7.0/preview/7.0.0-rc.2.md), but they don't list the same CVE, even though they copied and pasted the text from one release announcement to the other.   Apparently that CVE for .NET 7 RC 2 that's fixed is CVE-2022-38013 (though again, I wonder if that isn't a transposition error).
