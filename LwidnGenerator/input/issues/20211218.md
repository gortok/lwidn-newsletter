This is part two of 2021's greatest clicks on Last Week in .NET.  Today we'll cover July-Present, and speaking of Presents...  have you bought yours yet? Yea, that's a Christmas Joke.

Today also marks the day that we're driving back from Disney World by way of Charleston, because if you have young children, you're not making a 15 hour drive in a single day.  Historic Charleston is beautiful, and a special thanks to Kevin Jones (@vcsjones) on twitter for the Charleston recommendations.

### July

Back in July, CoPilot was released, and you all were quite interested in the fact that [you could trick CoPilot into coughing up someone's SendGrid API keys](https://fossbytes.com/github-copilot-generating-functional-api-keys/), which is both impressive and a "How the hell did they not have a private beta that consisted of people we would normally put on the naughty list" moment.


🏫 [Oskar Duycz has you covered with an updated readme and tutorial on event sourcing in .NET (Core)](https://twitter.com/oskar_at_net/status/1413097250679574530?s=20). If you think of event sourcing like that annoying kid in your 6th grade class that reminds the teacher when she forgot to assign homework and when the teacher forgot to give a scheduled quiz, it makes a lot more sense.  

⏳ Rick Strahl has a lengthy blog post [about converting the Desktop application Markdown Monster to use C#'s Async/Await](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Jul/07/Thoughts-on-AsyncAwait-Conversion-in-a-Desktop-App).  This is as an indepth dive into real-world async that you'll ever see and worth your time.

👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 [You know you can run multiple projects when you hit 'F5' in Visual Studio, right?](https://twitter.com/AndySterland/status/1415028388520087553?s=20) I love the gif method of teaching; and because of that I'll forgive the horrible experience we've taught ourselves is adequate with debugging multiple projects via F5.  

🏪 [Microsoft publishes its own applications through the Microsoft Store](https://twitter.com/RudyHuyn/status/1414705187898347522?s=20), making it about 95% of the Microsoft Store.

👨🏼‍🤝‍👨🏼[Cecil Philips and David Pine talk positional pattern matching in C# and how it works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tnepPn3Py8s) and true to the internet there's at least two commenters who thinks they know better than the language creators.

🔐 [Christo Matskas has a blog post out on how to Secure Open API (Swagger) calls with Azure Active Directory](https://dev.to/425show/secure-open-api-swagger-calls-with-azure-active-directory-jj7).

🕵️‍♀️ [Using Secrets in .NET Core Console Applications](https://santoshhari.wordpress.com/2021/07/26/using-app-secrets-in-dotnetcore-console-applications/) Console applications remain one of the least documented parts of the .NET Core experience (compared to ASP.NET), and I'm always happy to share content on that topic. Why are console applications important?  If you're in an event-driven microservices world in .NET, using a Console application to connect to your message queue and receive messages and put them into a database of some sort is an integral part of the work; as are services that respond to events but don't necessarily expose HTTP APIs.

### August

🐦 One thing I missed last week is that [Random.Shared is available in .NET 6](https://twitter.com/MrTurnerj/status/1419558163938902018). Yes, a threadsafe Random API, as opposed to a threadsafe _random_ API.

⚡ There's word that [LINQ statements will be twice as fast in .NET 6 than they are in .NET 5](https://twitter.com/realDotNetDave/status/1421495547727212555). David focuses on performance so I have no reason to doubt his word, and [apparently the benchmarks will be coming soon](https://dotnettips.wordpress.com/code-performance/).

🔮 [Magick.NET 8.2.0 has been released](https://github.com/dlemstra/Magick.NET/releases/tag/8.2.0) which is an image manipulation library for .NET.

🥉 [In a screenshot that is strangely alluring](https://twitter.com/maartenballiauw/status/1427275934562930693) Maarten shows off what VB looks like in the brave new world of .NET 6, with a pattern based XML Literal.  If I were to rate VB on this screenshot alone, I'd give it a 12/10. Having worked in VB, I give it a 4/10.  It's slightly ahead of the readability of JavaScript 5, and slightly behind Python.  These ratings are final.

🤷‍♂️ [The real names of features in Visual Studio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HNKUw17HhJA). It's a bit inside baseball, but still a wonderful walkthrough.

### September

⬇[Download New Azure Architecture Icons now!](https://www.thomasmaurer.ch/2020/07/download-new-azure-architecture-icons-now/) These icons look rather spiffy but you know some executive at Microsoft wanted the name 'Azure' somewhere on these icons.

🍧[David Fowler tweets a thread explaining the coolness behind Minimal APIs](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1435599554468929546), and I've said it before and I'll say it again. This is why I'm on twitter.  This sort of thing would have been too minor to make a whole blog post out of, but is perfect for twitter.

👀[Minimal APIs at a glance in .NET 6](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/minimal-apis-at-a-glance-in-net-6) Scott Hanselman digs into what minimal APIs are and how they work.  'Minimally' is apparently the right answer.

5️⃣[Nick Chapsas: 5 open source .NET projects that deserve more attention](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mwHWPoKEmyY). The five? NBomber, CSharpRepl, Verify, FluentDocker, Cupboard. If you want to know what these do, watch the video.

📦[.NET 6 will have a package validation tool](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/package-validation/) to make the nuget experience even more decadant.
