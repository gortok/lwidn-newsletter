Starting out this week a little differently, [Sarah Dresner, @sarah_edo on twitter](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo) comments on the Batman movies, and it's shockingly relevant to software we create:

> When they make Batman movies, they say "ah yes, this has all the ingredients of a good movie"
> The trouble is, you don't eat ingredients, you eat a meal.
> ([Source](https://twitter.com/sarah_edo/status/1520867430263771137))

She has an entire thread just on the problem with (primarily) DC movies, but it's definitely relevant to our work, and it reminds me of our approach to business applications (and a bit broader; large companies that rhyme with smike-ro-croft approach to building software).  We build software with features, (ingredients) but we generally forget the _soul_ of software; that part of it that makes it relatable to the user.  Features are not a _soul_, though a feature can be implemented with a soul.  Software that we love and software we merely tolerate (at best) are separated by whether or not it has a soul. üëª

[John Papa takes us through the early history of JavaScript and why jQuery saved JavaScript](https://twitter.com/John_Papa/status/1520899390122119170).  We look at these technologies with derision today, "Oh, you're still coding in jQuery? How can you?" but everything that is old and busted was once new and wonderful. ‚ú®

Aaron Stannard asks, ["Why does it seem like Microsoft deprecates all of their Azure SDK NuGet packages and replaces them with an entirely new one every 18 months?"](https://twitter.com/Aaronontheweb/status/1521511611952885761).  That's a great question, and the comments on the tweet offer possible explanations, but no one is speaking up in an official capacity. ‚ùì

[The people inside Microsoft using Windows Containers are talking about the cool stuff they can do](https://twitter.com/Aspenwilder/status/1521504440183713792).  If you're one of the five outside of Microsoft using Windows Containers voluntarily, you'll enjoy this as well. Also, if you're not a part of Microsoft and you're using Windows Containers _because you want to_ please drop me an email. It's george at georgestocker dot com. 5Ô∏è‚É£

[Microsoft 3D MovieMaker was released into opensource](https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft-3D-Movie-Maker) and the amazing part is that the software was built _last_.  The entire manual and documentation was created _first_. That's astonishing. üìö

Jimmy Bogard writes [You Probably Don't Need to Worry about MediatR](https://jimmybogard.com/you-probably-dont-need-to-worry-about-mediatr/) which itself is a response to this post that says, [You probably don't need MediatR](http://arialdomartini.github.io/mediatr) as someone who _has never used MediatR_, they're both right.

But what I want to bring up here is this mentality in software where we find these castles we believe in, live in those castles, and then eschew all the other castles we see. We build moats around ours, and see others as inferior.  We tie the software we use and create to our identity. We defend it.  

I also want to point out that Jimmy does a great job _of not doing that_ in his post.  He gives a reasoned rebuttal without it crossing any lines into attacks. ‚öî

[Jeffrey Snover talks about the time he was demoted and made a corporate pariah for five years for inventing Powershell](https://twitter.com/jsnover/status/1523280537686663169). There's [an accompanying talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nKyF8fzed0w&feature=youtu.be) on it.  Sometimes I get asked, "why do you hit Microsoft so hard when they do &lt;something I think is wrong&gt;", and stuff like this is the reason.  There's an inertia present in all businesses towards the present. Not towards innovation or getting better, but for extracting as much from the cash cow as possible. Microsoft is not only not immune to this, but there are many recent examples of this happening (Hot Reload, to name just one).  The 'new Microsoft' has not gotten away from this inertia, and if we just stay silent, there won't be any external forces helping them to see they are just relying on inertia.  As much as I dump on Powershell, it was revolutionary for Windows administrators, and it deserves more accolades.  In the replies [another Microsoftie talks about the fact that BitLocker was also one of these anti-inertia projects](https://twitter.com/MrDBCross/status/1523314967759376385).
