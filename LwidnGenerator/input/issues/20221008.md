[What the Hacker News Crowd wants Stack Overflow's Architecture to look like vs what it actually looks like](https://twitter.com/mstum/status/1577789388041379841)  I am glad they called out the problems with having an in-process Job scheduler.  And this may look different if you have lots of data-ingestion sources; but they don't, and overall, it's a picture of sanity.
