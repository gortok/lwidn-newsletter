### Last Week in .NET - Week ending 27 March 2021

It's a light week.  Not much going on except for me [being stung by the "30 is old in tech" rebuke](https://twitter.com/gortok/status/1376281359342256131).  What happened in the world of .NET (which turned 20 this year)? Let's get to it:

[Edit and Continue support for Linux? Not happening any time soon](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/12409).  The Jetbrains folks received complaints that Edit and Continue support for Linux wasn't available in Rider, and this particular rabbithole leads right to Microsoft's door step.

It's indicative of a bigger problem, that the promise of cross-platform .NET is the sort of promise you'd make like 'we should get together for lunch sometime' with a friend you bump into while shopping on a saturday afternoon.

[Releasing Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.3530.0 to the Beta & Release Preview Channels](https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/03/25/releasing-windows-feature-experience-pack-120-2212-3530-0-to-the-beta-release-preview-channels/).  The title is almost as long as what they actually released, to wit: 

> "We are improving the reliability of displaying the candidate list for users of the Input Method Editor (IME)."

[C# holds steady as the 5th most popular language](https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-rankings-javascript-still-rules-python-holds-off-java/?utm_content=156352590&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&hss_channel=tw-4083531) according to Redmonk.

The fact that JavaScript is number 1 is proof-positive more people are into masochism than we know.

[Create ZIP files on HTTP request without intermediate files using ASP.NET MVC, Razor Pages, and endpoints](https://swimburger.net/blog/dotnet/create-zip-files-on-http-request-without-intermediate-files-using-aspdotnet-mvc-razor-pages-and-endpoints) The take away here is that using this technique you can create zip files without writing files to disk on your server.  Especially handy if you're into that <strike>cgi-bin</strike> serverless craze.

[NewtonSoft.Json 13.0.1 has been released](https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/tag/13.0.1).  New major version number, and it looks like the 'breaking change' is the default `MaxDepth`:

> Change - JsonReader and JsonSerializer MaxDepth defaults to 64

There are a smattering of bug fixes along for the ride as well.

It was a light week in the world of .NET, and with Easter coming up in the states, you can expect this week to be light too.
