🌇 [Sunsetting of .NET Framework and .NET Core runners in Cake 2.0](https://cakebuild.net/blog/2021/10/sunsetting-runners) Cake now requires .NET Core 3.1 or higher.  

❗ [Marten V4: Hard Deletes, Soft Deletes, Un-Deletes, All the Deletes you Meet](https://jeremydmiller.com/2021/10/11/marten-v4-hard-deletes-soft-deletes-un-deletes-all-the-deletes-you-meet/) Marten is a Document DB that sits atop Postgres; and 4.0 now has softdelete support and support to undelete.

🏃‍♀️ [ML.NET Updates & Announcing Notebookx in Visual Studio](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/ml-net-and-model-builder-october-updates/) I'm impressed that Microsoft chose to publish the painpoint "Afraid Microsoft will abandon the [ML.NET] framework". Silly users, don't you know that they don't abandon it, they just stop developing for it? Secondly the answer to that painpoint doesn't actually address the painpoint.

👀 [Webview UI Toolkit for Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2021/10/11/webview-ui-toolkit) This finally puts the 'visual' in Visual Studio Code.

🌟🦗[Migrating our trusty ol' .NET Framework applications to AWS, I couldn't believe it](https://medium.com/i-love-my-local-farmer-engineering-blog/migrating-our-trusty-ol-net-framework-applications-to-aws-i-couldn-t-believe-it-2b111fcd8146) So A Senior Specialist Solutions Architect at AWS (François Bouteruche) put together this "story" about fictional migrations to AWS for .NET Teams, as an amalgamation of experiences he's had... working for AWS. Migrating .NET customers to... AWS.  The first paragraph makes it seem like this is an actual story, but it's not.  Disclaimer doesn't come until Paragraph 2.  I see you, AWS. This comes suspiciously close to astro-turfing, AWS.
 
🚀[Join us November 8 for the Launch of Visual Studio 2022](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/visualstudio/join-us-november-8th-for-the-launch-of-visual-studio-2022/) Visual Studio 2022 launches on November 8th, as it states on the tin, but today you can download the Release Candidate.

😶[Use of Github Enterprise](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/59) Rob Prouse, Board member of the .NET Foundation, explains what happened with all member projects for the .NET Foundation.  In case you missed last week's newsletter, it was discovered that the .NET Foundation required member projects to allow a service account, dnfadmin to have owner rights on the repository, and then secretly went in and transferred ownership of those projects to the .NET Foundation on Github Enterprise.   Rob [refers to this as a 'mistake', as in "the current board thinks it should not have happened"](https://twitter.com/rprouse/status/1448119722218819584?s=20).  That response, of course, tells us nothing about why it did happen, which they're convienently silent on.

👉Reed Cospey gives his [Detailed thoughts on the State of the .NET Foundation](https://github.com/dotnet-foundation/Home/discussions/60). Reed is the Executive Director of the F# foundation, (Once again, someone that uses F# can't resist telling us that), and he gives a great overview of the structural problems with the .NET Foundation -- far better than my incoherent ramblings on the subject.  It's worth your time to read if you care about .NET adoption.

🗣The [.NET Foundation is holding a "Tell me Anything" session on October 27th](https://twitter.com/rprouse/status/1448781495959703552). This is your chance to tell them how you feel about the .NET Foundation's recent actions.  


🙅‍♂️ [Visual Studio 2022 for Mac Preview](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/mac/preview/) will now sport a native Mac UI, and not a cross-platform UI. It's good -- we like performance, but it's also bad because it feels like an offering like Xamarin shouldn't have these issues.. Oh yea, and [Microsoft purchased Xamarin, so they won't even use their own product](https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2016/02/24/microsoft-to-acquire-xamarin-and-empower-more-developers-to-build-apps-on-any-device/)?

📴 [Microsoft says it is shutting down LinkedIn in China](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/microsoft-linkedin-china-shutting-down/) Which seems weird because the Chinese Government and LinkedIn have something in common: They both want to know who's been looking at your profile on LinkedIn. 

👨‍🎓 [Governor Mike Parson threatens Jail time for reporter who right-click and Viewed Source on Missouri Government website and saw Social Security Numbers](https://twitter.com/GovParsonMO/status/1448697768311132160).  He has since [doubled down on being a moron](https://twitter.com/GovParsonMO/status/1448750830857904129).

📢[.NET 6.0 RC 2 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/6.0/preview/6.0.0-rc.2.md) This release has a Go-Live license, so use it in production.

📢[.NET 5.0.11 has been released](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/main/release-notes/5.0/5.0.11/5.0.11.md) This release fixes CVE-2021-41355 which is a .NET Core Information Disclosure Vulnerability.

[.NET Core 3.1.20 has also been released](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/october-2021-updates/) and it has that CVE fix as well as other bug fixes.

With Indigeonous People's/Columbus day, it was a short week last week.  There'll be a lull before November when .NET 6 officially launches, and of course when it does so I'll be there, to let you know what's going on.
