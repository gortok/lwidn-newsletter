.NET 6 is coming this week, Emojis are the harbinger of the end times, and Nat Friedman leaves Github.

🐎 ['Trojan Source' Bug Threatens the Security of All Code](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/11/trojan-source-bug-threatens-the-security-of-all-code/). Turns out rules for handling unicode in source code include the ability to inject code into the compiler.  If the first attack using this method doesn't use [the new Goose emoji](https://www.unicode.org/L2/L2021/21219-goose-emoji.pdf), I will be disappointed.

🏔 [Server side ALPN support for SslStream on Mac](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/27727)  Someone out there reading this understands the implications, the only thing I understand is that this fix will not be in .NET 6.  One other thing, when you reply to make me smarter on this subject, please let me know if ALPN is pronounced "Alpine". If it isn't I can't take that much disappointment in one day.

🔗 [Learn how to integrate npm and webpack into the build process for your Razor Class Library](https://twitter.com/aspnet/status/1455214336431910915) And people say masochism has no analogue in technology.

🔊 [Episode 84 - ASP.NET Core 5 Design Patterns with Carl-Hugo Marcotte](https://dotnetcore.show/episode-84-asp-net-core-5-design-patterns-with-carl-hugo-marcotte/)  This is a newsletter link about a podcast about a book about ASP.NET Core Design Patterns.

💾 [Session highlight: Running .NET Workloads on IBM Z](https://twitter.com/ZayrusRomero/status/1455207853195673600) This will be at .NET Conf, and while my talk on Event Driven Architectures in .NET was declined, you get to hear about IBM Z workloads, which impacts virtually no one in the .NET Industry. IBM sponsored .NET Conf, didn't they. *checks [https://dotnetconf.net](https://dotnetconf.net) front page*. yes, yes they did.  

Two extra swipes at this because a bad move requires more snark:

1. Losing sucks, losing to IBM sucks even worse.
2. It's hard to say you're looking for "widely applicable" talks when you accept a talk about running on IBM.

📝 [CODE Magazine - Essential C# 10, Making it Simpler](https://www.codemag.com/article/2111052) In the context of 'simple' adding record structs and mutable record structs to record classes does not seem like it's making things "simpler", but that's just me.

🗺 [Microsoft rolls out Visio to Microsoft 365 Commercial users](https://twitter.com/jerrynixon/status/1455234461801455616) I have a soft spot in my heart for visio, and while I won't purchase Microsft 365, I applaud this move.

🥤[Microsoft created a full Notion clone using its Azure Fluid Framework](https://twitter.com/Suhail/status/1455553539552382979). If you haven't heard of Fluid, just visit its [website and be even more confused](https://fluidframework.com/).  "Data Sync Reimagined: real time. Web first. Open Source".  The good news is that those are up to date buzzwords, the bad news is that I have no idea what they're trying to say. But it's cool, right?  That trumps clarity.

🟦 ☁[Azure Container Apps now available as a serverless offering on Azure](https://twitter.com/jeffhollan/status/1455553207468388354) Allows you to write microservices without any ceremony.

📱[What's new In Mobile device Enrollment and Management for Windows 11, Version 21H2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/client-management/mdm/new-in-windows-mdm-enrollment-management).

💵[Understanding the cost of C# delegates](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/understanding-the-cost-of-csharp-delegates/) This is cool from a technical perspective but from a realistic perspective: If you don't want to use delegates you may as well only use C# 1.0.

🙇‍♂️[Thank you, Github](https://github.blog/2021-11-03-thank-you-github/) Nat Friedman writes about his departure as Github's CEO.

🚪 [Github CEO Nat Friedman is leaving, Thomas Dohmke named new CEO](https://www.protocol.com/bulletins/github-new-ceo-nat-friedman) The new "CEO" reports to the DevDiv president, [who orchestrated the Hot Reload debacle](https://georgestocker.com/2021/10/25/last-week-in-net-65-lets-skip-to-the-part-where-you-dont-do-this-again/).

👋Thomas Dohmke fills out this trifecta by writing ["Building the next phase of Github, together"](https://github.blog/2021-11-03-building-the-next-phase-of-github-together/). It's filled with the usual fluff and doesn't address the fact that the org chart changed and Tom (can I call him Tom?) is a glorified VP in Microsoft's DevDiv.  Maybe Nat left because he didn't want to dance to this new tune?

🌠[Windbg 1.2110.27001 Preview has been released](https://twitter.com/timmisiak/status/1455974369390260224) and the new Windbg now uses WPF, and has a sleeker look, or so I'm told.

🙊🙉🙈[Apple argues Sideloading is too big a risk](https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/3/22761724/apple-craig-federighi-ios-sideloading-web-summit-2021-european-commission-digital-markets-act).  If we're going to say installing apps is too big a risk, we might as well say users are too big a risk.

⌚[Visual Studio is now on TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@visualstudio/video/7026423558041537839) Hello fellow kids.

😴[Microsoft Publishes New Documentation for Blazor, ASP.NET Core](https://visualstudiomagazine.com/articles/2021/11/04/new-aspnet-core-docs.aspx) I hope the documentation isn't as boring as the article title.

🤑[Native AOT Is coming in .NET 7](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/61231) Let's hope they don't make this Visual Studio only.

⁉[David Pine asks you to please use Microsoft Q&A for .NET](https://twitter.com/davidpine7/status/1456609421048549385?s=20) Please clap.

🙏[Thanks Microsoft for open-sourcing VS Code Server](https://www.gitpod.io/blog/vscode-server) I'm interested to see what comes of this.  Microsoft initially declined to open source VS Code Server, so Gitpod launched its own OpenVSCode Server, and now Microsoft is open sourcing VS Code Server so they don't appear as if they were caught with their pants down.

🆕[The F# docs have been improved](https://twitter.com/dsymetweets/status/1456610376171274241) and the tweet thread does a far better job of explaining document updates.  Visual Studio Magazine, take note.

😒[Microsoft MVP told to give up award because they work for Microsoft's cloud competition](https://twitter.com/RajYRaman/status/1457089745410875397).  This did not use to be true, but now it is.  I guess "Valuable" here relates to "Valuable to Microsoft" not "Valuable to the community".

and lastly,

[Microsoft employees are upset about all the ".NET Drama"](https://twitter.com/davidwengier/status/1457135558409347077).  As a personal reflection: Anytime someone uses the word 'drama' to describe another person's lived experience, it's always in a derogatory and dismissive fashion.

.NET 6 is being released this week, so we should have a lot more to talk about next week in .NET.
