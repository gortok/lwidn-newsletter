Saturday marked the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001 attacks; the effects of which changed the lives of billions of people.  In a "very significant to me" moment but "incredibly insignificant to the world" view, I would never have met my wife or have the life and kids I have today if it weren't for September 11th.  A terrible event and aftermath that shaped the reality as we know it. But this is not reminisce with George Stocker, it's Last Week in .NET, so let's get to it.

üëÄ[Minimal APIs at a glance in .NET 6](https://www.hanselman.com/blog/minimal-apis-at-a-glance-in-net-6) Scott Hanselman digs into what minimal APIs are and how they work.  'Minimally' is apparently the right answer.

üçß[David Fowler tweets a thread explaining the coolness behind Minimal APIs](https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1435599554468929546), and I've said it before and I'll say it again. This is why I'm on twitter.  This sort of thing would have been too minor to make a whole blog post out of, but is perfect for twitter.

üé©[Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Cobra Command, and other tech companies are in a 'frenzy' to help ICE build its own data-mining tool for targeting unauthorized workers](https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-google-microsoft-ice-raven-data-mining-tool-undocumented-workers-2021-8) "Don't be Evil" has a second part that isn't usually vocalized: "unless we can make money being evil."  

üêà[Matrix Resurrections: Offical Trailer #1 is out](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9ix7TUGVYIo) 1999 called, and the Low rise jeans are coming back as well.  This trailer made me very happy, and I hope the 4th iteration of the Matrix captures the magic the first one held.

‚ûñ[An Opinionated Look at Minimal API in .NET 6](https://dev.to/nikiforovall/an-opinionated-look-at-minimal-api-in-net-6-33pd) a look at one of the possible ways to put minimal APIs into action.  This is a first blush attempt, and while it may not be the solution, it at least gets us asking the right questions.

[Github (2008) Merges 'useless garbage' says Linux Torvalds as new NTFS (1993) support added to Linux (1991) kernel 5.15](https://www.theregister.com/2021/09/06/github_merges_useless_garbage_says/) The creator of Git(2005) [says that Github creates useless merges](https://lore.kernel.org/lkml/CAHk-=wjbtip559HcMG9VQLGPmkurh5Kc50y5BceL8Q8=aL0H3Q@mail.gmail.com/), while conversing on a listserve (1986) and accepting merge requests through Email (1971) .patch files.  Does Linux surf the World Wide Web (1991)? I have to wonder.

As promised last week, this week was a light week.  I'll see you all next week.
