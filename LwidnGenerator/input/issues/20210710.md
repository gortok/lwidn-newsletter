### Week ending July 10th, 2021

Jetbrains' Simon Cropp is hosting an ["OSS Power-ups: Verify"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZD5-51iCmU0) event and I have no fracking idea what any of these words put together means.  Which, if you think about it is entirely on brand for OSS, where marketing is shunned.

Rick Strahl has a lengthy blog post [about converting the Desktop application Markdown Monster to use C#'s Async/Await](https://weblog.west-wind.com/posts/2021/Jul/07/Thoughts-on-AsyncAwait-Conversion-in-a-Desktop-App).  This is as an indepth dive into real-world async that you'll ever see and worth your time.

Microsoft released a patch against the PrintNightmare vulnerability and [lo-and-behold it doesn't actually mitigate the vulnerability](https://petri.com/microsofts-printnightmare-patch-not-effective-against-vulnerability), writes Brad Sams. Who among us hasn't had a patch that "Worked on my machine"?  Now none of us are worth 2.09 Trillion, but does that *really* change things?

[.NET Conf "focus on F#" is July 29th, and you can sign up here](https://focus.dotnetconf.net/#:~:text=NET%20Conf%3A%20Focus%20on%20F%23%20is%20a%20free%2C%20one%2D,powerful%20type%20system%20and%20the%20) Now's your chance to learn about F# and tell the world about it.

[The Pentagon has cancled the disputed JEDI cloud contract with Microsoft](https://apnews.com/article/amazoncom-inc-technology-business-government-and-politics-83dae68a0ed4e24246900a1d1d1d00be?utm_medium=AP&utm_source=Twitter&utm_campaign=SocialFlow) and in order for the project not to spend the next ten years in litigation will pursue a multi-cloud strategy -- with Amazon, Microsoft, and possibly other cloud vendors. We are in the "Too big to deal with" stage of capitalism decline.

[Did you ever want to check to see if if the app is being run as sudo or admin on linux](https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/25118#issuecomment-367407469)? This code snippet will help you do just that.

[Several Netfilter Rootkits -- signed by Microsoft -- hit the wild today](https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1411988717611458564).  In case that sentence didn't sufficiently scare the shit out of you; a rootkit is bad. Microsoft signing rootkits is about as bad as it gets. It's like your spouse giving a crook the keys to your house and letting them know when you all will be gone.

Wassim Chegham writes about [10 Things to Know about Azure Static Web Apps](https://dev.to/azure/10-things-to-know-about-azure-static-web-apps-3n4i) and this is a good write up and a reminder that Microsoft is very late to this party but markets as if they created sliced bread.
