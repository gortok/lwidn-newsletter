### DevIntersection is hosting a 2-day series of workshops on .NET:

https://virtual.devintersection.com/#!/ is hosting a virtual 2-day series of workshop for the corporate friendly price of $199 on September 1st and 2nd 2020. Speakers include some pretty big names in the .NET space, including the Gu (sigh. Fine, "Scott Guthrie"), Kimberly Tripp, , Carl Franklin, Michelle Bustamente, and Scott Hunter.

Each workshop is $199 and for that you also get access to the free keynotes.  I signed up for the keynotes, and understand that if you do, [you can be entered to win an XBox or a free workshop](https://twitter.com/AzureAIConf/status/1294786197634547714?s=20)

### Scott Hanselman releases a video explaining the .NET Ecosystem

If you're new to .NET (or even if you aren't) this video by Scott Hanselman explains the .NET ecosystem in all its 20 year sprawling majesty in a [youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bEfBfBQq7EE&feature=youtu.be).

Tempted to make a TikTok. Let's GO!<sup>*</sup>.  

### Maoni Stephens releases a 3 part series on the .NET GC on Youtube

[Maoni Stephens shares how the GC works in three parts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3j3PDln7Z2I). I love these sorts of videos.  I had to learn about the GC from Jeffrey Richter's "CLR via C#" book (back when there was only 1 edition), and now we can learn this stuff on Youtube.  There's a little bit of jealousy, but mostly I'm grateful for people who take the time to share this stuff.

### Mads Torgerson addresses the viral "stuff I wish C# had but doesn't" tweet

Mads went to twitter to address the tweet that made it on the Orange Site that detailed some changes the author wishes C# had. [Mads wrote](https://twitter.com/MadsTorgersen/status/1294581581617782785?s=20):

> This is a great list of useful features missing from C#. They aren't fundamental flaws and could all be addressed; many are already on the radar for future versions. E.g. primary constructors are planned for C# 10.0, and could then be a building block for object expressions.

I'm not really one to ask about all these new features because I'd be perfectly happy with C# 5.  Some of the newer features are rather nice; but I don't think fundamental tinkering with the syntax of a language is a great way to maintain language cohesiveness.  Call me old fashioned. 

### Did you know the ASP.NET community team holds a weekly Standup?

I'm not sure it's actually a standup but naming is hard.  Anyway, you can check it weekly, [here](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/platform/community/standup).
