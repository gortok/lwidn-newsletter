<p>Github, the eponymous source control collaboration system for Open Source Projects, has been caught trying to sneakily continue its contracts with ICE -- you know, the government agency that puts kids in cages -- by getting a contract award from ICE through Dell Federal Systems.</p>
<p>Now all of this may be on the up-and-up; Dell sells Github enterprise to ICE as a reseller, Github gets plausible deniability, and ICE gets to use the cool kids source control system.</p>
<p>But it's still morally bankrupt for Github to take this contract -- for an amount, I might add, that totals $79,312.50, or roughly the same amount Microsoft should have paid Keivan for using his AppGet architectural work in their WinGet package manager solution.</p>
<p>We see you, Github. Special thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/davetron5000/status/1282738504624222208?s=20">Dave Copeland</a> for making me aware of this. Twitter is sometimes a beautiful thing.</p>
<h3 id="nick-craver-talks-attacks-on-stack-overflow">Nick Craver talks Attacks on Stack Overflow.</h3>
<p>Stack Overflow, the largest (that gets developer press and isn't Microsoft owned) site built on ASP.NET MVC (and soon .NET Core), gets a lot of attacks against it as a &quot;top 50&quot; (according to Wikipedia) site on the internet.  Nick Craver, their architectural lead; goes deep into the sorts of attacks that happen. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6NECAZhJG4">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K6NECAZhJG4</a> This is a good watch. Watch it.</p>
<h3 id="performance-improvements-in.net-5">Performance Improvements in .NET 5</h3>
<p>This is the sort of thing I get jazzed about.  The faster C# gets, the less we have to worry about using a language like Go or Rust for high performance situations.  I don't use Rust, but anyone that does will tell you within seconds of meeting you.  They're our Crossfitters.</p>
<p>Anyway, having an easy-to-use toolchain to write fast code is good for all of us; and really good for our economic prospects, if we're being honest.  The .NET team gets jazzed about performance too, and they've released another blog post <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/performance-improvements-in-net-5/">detailing speed improvements in the forthcoming (now in Preview) .NET 5</a>.  .NET 5, remember, is just .NET Core in a trench coat.  Microsoft is going directly from .NET Core 3 to .NET 5; because awkwardly, they already have a .NET 4.  I have lots of jokes to make about Microsoft Marketing, but I'd like to be clear about this: Microsoft has 20 years of inertia around the .NET Framework, and there were problem dozens of internal corporate teams that were hoping that .NET Core would fail because their bread and butter was built on .NET.  Luckily it didn't fail, and luckily the group that said &quot;Let's unify the two&quot; won.  Over time .NET Core has had to make concessions to stay in the game, like CSProj over project.json; but those concessions have ultimately scored large wins for both .NET Framework and .NET Core.  This is a narrow line to walk, and for all the grief I give them, Microsoft's Marketing team is handling this with grace and aplomb.</p>
<h3 id="on.net-maui">On .NET MAUI</h3>
<p>I had understood <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/maui">.NET MAUI</a> to be a codename for .NET 6. It is not.  Part of .NET 6 will be 'MAUI'. It's capitalized because it's an acroynmn. I should have known, of course, as we're programmers, and we love Acroymns.  Anyway, MAUI stands for: Multi-platform App UI.  Or for the rest of us: Cross Platform UIs!</p>
<p>YES. FINALLY. Something that will be faster than electron and have less users to boot! Seriously though, I'm pretty stoked that this is happening, though I hope Microsoft will take this time to realize that cross-platform UIs are probably best done in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and not XAML. Actually, scratch that, Cross platform UIs are terrible in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but it's ubitquitous, and that's what matters.  It looks like there will be a few 'AppModels' supported:
MVVM, RxUI, MVU, Blazor.  If you don't do Xamarin currently, RxUI and MVU will be new to you (and to the rest of us).  RxUI is a &quot;reactive&quot; style of programming to support one-way updates from the model to the UI. and MVU is &quot;Model View Update&quot;, which I hear is cool but apparently every framework needs to create a new rendering pattern, and <a href="https://thomasbandt.com/model-view-update">MVU is Elm's gift</a> to the rest of us.  Programmers create their own blog engines, UI Frameworks write their own Rendering pattern.</p>

<p>If you're using .NET (Whether Framework or Core), and you want to benchmark your code, you should be using <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/BenchmarkDotNet">Benchmark.NET</a>.  It's called Benchmark because that's what it does, and they slapped the .NET moniker on the end because that's what library authors for .NET Do.  Since this is .NET, their alternatives were NBenchmark, and BenchmarkSharp. I'm glad Benchmark.NET won.</p>
<p>Anyway, Benchmark.NET let's you set up runs against your code; specifically against doing the same operation multiple ways. It then accurately benchmarks how fast the code is, what sort of memory usage it has, and a few other neat sundries about it.</p>
<p>If you're using System.Timer(), don't. Use Benchmark.NET instead. (This is not a sponsored ad, but I do have a thing for Console Applications that are amazing)</p>
<h3 id="events.net">Events.NET</h3>
<p>The .NET Conf is November 10th-12th, online only.  It's the 10th year of this event.  You can <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/?WT.mc_id=twc9-c9-chwarren">save the date here</a>.   If you're not a fan of sitting through three days of online events, I'll be live-tweeting it; In preparation, you can go ahead and block me now.</p>
