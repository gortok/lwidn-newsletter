<h3>Last Week in .NET - 17 April 2021</h3>
<p>🚨🚨🚨🚨<a href="https://twitter.com/GossiTheDog/status/1382016434289704960">Microsoft Exchange has four new vulnerabilities with patches</a>. CVE-2021-28480, CVE-2021-28481, CVE-2021-28482 and CVE-2021-28483.  For some things the cloud does not make sense, but for the &quot;I really don't want to deal with patching my own stuff&quot;, the cloud makes sense.  Maybe it's time to migrate to O365, if you haven't already?</p>
<p>By the way, this is so bad that <a href="https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/nsa-discovers-critical-exchange-server-vulnerabilities-patch-now/">the <em>NSA is actually telling everyone about these flaws immediately</em></a>.</p>
<p>😆<a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111/status/1381704459684831234?s=20">Schadenfruede is watching someone else try to set up Microsoft Teams</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/mcclure111">&#64;mcclure111</a> tries to set up Microsoft Teams to talk to a client, and all hell breaks loose.  It's a fun read if you define fun as &quot;I'm glad that isn't happening to me&quot; and &quot;Holy cow did Microsoft not think through their user experience?&quot;</p>
<p>📆<a href="https://pages.jetbrains.com/dotnet-days-2021/twitter">Jetbrains &quot;.Net Days&quot; is May 11-12th</a> and it's free. Scheduled talks include</p>
