<p>🚨🚨🚨 <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/resources/3-ways-to-mitigate-risk-using-private-package-feeds/">Microsoft releases a whitepaper on mitigating risk when using Private package feeds</a>  This dovetails <a href="https://twitter.com/alxbrsn/status/1359200840876257287?s=20">with the security researcher who wrote about how they hijack'd namespaces for private feeds</a>; and Microsoft releases a whitepaper on this issue and how to mitigate this.
