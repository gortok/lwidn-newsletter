<p>Here in the States, we recorded the first invasion of the Capitol since the war of 1812 (in 1814), the first time a sitting president has incited an insurrection, and the last time any of us will hold out hope that it being a new year will mean things get better.</p>
<p>With that as our backdrop, let's get down to what happened last week in the world of .NET:</p>
<p>🗣<a href="https://www.dotnet-frontend.com/">.NET Frontend day is January 28th, 2020</a>. This conference goes through the various technologies you can use to build <em>front-end</em> applications in .NET. Expect lots of blazor.</p>
<p>📰<a href="https://www.codemag.com/Article/2010102/Blazor-Updates-in-.NET-5">CODE Magazine released an article about Blazor Updates in .NET 5</a>.  CODE Magazine was my first foray into the world of .NET (this was back in 2000), and I remember reading through the articles fondly.  I think I'm going to go subscribe to the print edition again.</p>
<p>🍾<a href="https://foundation.fsharp.org/welcome_to_2021">Reed Cospey writes a beginning of year message to the F# Foundation community</a> 2020 decimated in-person conferences, and the expectations are that it'll be August before we can even think about resuming in-person conferences, with the more likely outcome that conferences will resume in 2022. If they resume.</p>
<p>📝<a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/blog/software-development/domain-driven-design-csharp">Julie Lerman blogs about using C#9 records as Domain Driven Design immutable value objects in C# 9</a> I love Julie's writing, and I hope you'll enjoy it too.</p>
<p>📝<a href="https://medium.com/&#64;waelkdouh/microfrontends-with-blazor-webassembly-b25e4ba3f325">How to build Microfront ends with Blazor WebAssembly</a> Micro-frontends are complicated and we're not there yet, but I'm glad more people are blogging about the possibilities.</p>
<p>🚩<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/serverless/comments/krbj8y/aws_credentials_being_sent_to_serverlesscom_what/">Do you use Serverless.com? If so, your AWS credentials are being transmitted</a>.  In a &quot;well, fuck&quot; moment, Serverless uses your AWS credentials to do its work. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/serverless/comments/krbj8y/aws_credentials_being_sent_to_serverlesscom_what/gi9b1en/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=web2x&amp;context=3">An AWS engineer even chimed in on what Serverless.com <em>should</em> do</a>.</p>

<p>📝<a href="https://blog.jetbrains.com/blog/2021/01/06/statement-on-the-story-from-the-new-york-times-regarding-jetbrains-and-solarwinds/">Jetbrains fights back over allegations that their &quot;Team City&quot; product contributed to the Solarwinds intrusion</a>.  The New-York times alleged that Jetbrains &quot;Team City&quot; was partially responsible for the Solarwinds hack, and this rightfully ruffled some feathers at JetBrains HQ.  They dive into their findings as to why Team City isn't at fault.</p>
<p>📝<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/msdn-magazine/2018/january/csharp-all-about-span-exploring-a-new-net-mainstay">Do you use Span<T>?</a> If so, there's a handy chart that helps you understand what you can cast and when, not to mention a really informative article on Span<T> itself.  h/t to <a href="https://twitter.com/daveaglick/status/1347165278027788299">&#64;DaveAGlick</a> for the share.</p>
<p>🐦<a href="https://twitter.com/Arlodottxt/status/1343354814818885633">There's a thread of a thread about &quot;Project Reunion&quot;</a>, aka &quot;Make Windows UI development not suck again&quot;.  These sorts of insights are why I use twitter.  Before Twitter you would have hoped for a blog post or ten, or maybe a video post-mortem; but these sorts of insights were just not available due to the cost of publishing a blog post on the subject. With tweets, the barrier to entry is low.  Yea, that can be a problem, but that's a whole other problem to deal with.</p>
<p>📽<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xGIkGX2FXPE">There's a video out detailing changes you'll see in .NET 6.</a>.  If you aren't already on the &quot;.NET updates yearly, get ready&quot; train, you should be.  Minor versions happen every month or every few months, and major versions are released yearly.  Yes, .NET 6 is 11 months away, and is going to be 'the release' for large enterprises to move to .NET (core).</p>
<p>📝<a href="https://github.com/unoplatform/Uno.Wasm.Bootstrap/pull/325">If you want Cross platform .NET UI's right now, use UNO</a>.  In this PR, Uno now supports AOT Profile filtering. No, I don't know what this means, but you probably do.</p>
<p>📝<a href="https://nicksnettravels.builttoroam.com/trust-appcontainers/">Nick Randolph discusses Full Trust and Partial trust and how that relates to Windows app Container</a>.  Yes,  this is more for the desktop crowd but still interesting to see where Microsoft is going for its UI strategy.</p>
<p>And that's what happened last week in the world of .NET.  I'm putting together an intro to <em>modern</em> day TDD webinar, and if that sort of thing interests you, hit reply and let me know.</p>
