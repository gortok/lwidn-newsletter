<h3>Last Week in .NET - Week Ending 24 April 2021</h3>
<p>Not many releases last week, but lots of shenanigans.  I spelled that word on the first try which matters not a whit to anyone else but I'm proud of myself.  The shenanigans themselves are an age old story: Big Corporation finds feeble consumers, and exploits them.</p>
<p>🤑 <a href="https://www.crn.com.au/news/microsoft-pushes-mvps-influencers-to-spruik-azure-in-lead-up-to-aws-reinvent-563623">Microsoft pushes MVP Influencers to Spruik Azure in Lead up to AWS: Reinvent</a>. That's the headline, here's the story: Microsoft wants the community MVPs to shill for SQL Server on Azure and claim it's cheaper and better, when the fact that SQL Server is more expensive on AWS is due to Microsoft's own shenanigans.  When an MVP called this out as the bad behavior it is, Microsoft removed them from the MVP Program.</p>
<p>Microsoft seems to want MVPs to shill for Microsoft, forgetting that any of the trust these MVPs have is <em>because they don't shill for Microsoft</em>.</p>

<p>🏬<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/windows-10-big-changes-coming-app-store">Microsoft is building a new app store for Windows 10 in major revitalization effort</a>.  Microsoft is, at its heart, an enterprise software company.  It's the only way to explain why so many of their consumer efforts have failed.  To have a successful app store, you have to give developers a compelling reason to write for it and for consumers to adopt it.  As of yet, neither has happened with desktop App stores.</p>
