<h3>.NET Core fails to build from source:</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/11795">https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/11795</a> - This was both frightening and &quot;I did not know that&quot; moment. If there are security vulnerabilities; the nightly won't build. If an internal package is removed, nightlies won't build.</p>

.NET Conf &quot;Focus on Microservices&quot; Playlist now on youtube.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUc2ShrReCS7KoBbPEONE0p">https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oUc2ShrReCS7KoBbPEONE0p</a> - I recommend avoiding the talk on DAPR; if microservices are a solution in search of a problem, consider DAPR its king. Pretty cool from an engineering perspective, but doesn't actually solve a problem people launching Microservices have (If you really want to change your data-store on the fly from SQL to No-SQL, reach out. I just want to talk.</p>
<h3>Microsoft let's employees sponsor open source projects at $10,00 a piece.</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/microsoft-sponsorships/microsoft-foss-fund/blob/main/README.md">https://github.com/microsoft-sponsorships/microsoft-foss-fund/blob/main/README.md</a> This is nice of Microsoft; they let their employees vote on FOSS projects to give $10,000 to, and then the three top projects chosen get $10,000.</p>
<p>I guess that means Microsoft <em>can</em> pay for OSS when they want to.</p>
<p>Shout out to Jeff Wilcox for the Tweet letting me know about this.</p>
<h3>Microsoft's Ignite - September 22-24 2020</h3>

<h3>PFCLofW (pretty fricking cool library of the week)</h3>
<p><a href="https://storyteller.github.io/">Storyteller</a> is a library that lets you write markdown to specify your system; and then turns those into executable tests. I know, I know, customer written tests are snake-oil. They have been and always will be; Now if you could specify your tests in excel? That might be the ticket. Still, this is a cool library to check out, even if only from an engineering perspective.</p>
