<p>🙅‍♂️ <a href="https://twitter.com/MicrosoftTeams/status/1394278227124830210?s=20">Microsoft Teams is now available for personal use</a>.   I want to have the confidence of the executive that this would be a hit.  Also in a facepalm moment, <a href="https://twitter.com/MicrosoftTeams/status/1394671292171890689?s=20">you must have both a Microsoft Account and a Phone number to use Teams for personal use</a>.

It sounds cool, but the number of use-cases that <em>need</em> something like this is small. You can also read about <a href="https://reaqtive.net/#a-little-history-of-reaqtor">the history of Reaqtor</a>, and <a href="https://twitter.com/GeoffreyHuntley/status/1394658887396069383?s=20">&#64;geoffreyHuntley has a twitter thread that includes the highlights</a></p>

The form present in this 'guide' is corporate jargon.  It's hard to dispute something when you can't understand what the hell they're trying to say.</p>
<p>It's a light week because Build is this week; and so next week's Last Week in .NET will be all about Microsoft Build.  Confused?  Not as much as you would be if you tried to read the Flexibility Guide.</p>
