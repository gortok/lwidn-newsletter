<h3>Last Week in .NET - Week ending 27 March 2021</h3>
<p>It's a light week.  Not much going on except for me <a href="https://twitter.com/gortok/status/1376281359342256131">being stung by the &quot;30 is old in tech&quot; rebuke</a>.  What happened in the world of .NET (which turned 20 this year)? Let's get to it:</p>
<p>ü§û <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/12409">Edit and Continue support for Linux? Not happening any time soon</a>.  The Jetbrains folks received complaints that Edit and Continue support for Linux wasn't available in Rider, and this particular rabbithole leads right to Microsoft's door step.</p>
<p>It's indicative of a bigger problem, that the promise of cross-platform .NET is the sort of promise you'd make like 'we should get together for lunch sometime' with a friend you bump into while shopping on a saturday afternoon.</p>
<p>üí´ <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/03/25/releasing-windows-feature-experience-pack-120-2212-3530-0-to-the-beta-release-preview-channels/">Releasing Windows Feature Experience Pack 120.2212.3530.0 to the Beta &amp; Release Preview Channels</a>.  The title is almost as long as what they actually released, to wit:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;We are improving the reliability of displaying the candidate list for users of the Input Method Editor (IME).&quot;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>üî® <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/programming-language-rankings-javascript-still-rules-python-holds-off-java/?utm_content=156352590&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-4083531">C# holds steady as the 5th most popular language</a> according to Redmonk.</p>
<p>The fact that JavaScript is number 1 is proof-positive more people are into masochism than we know.</p>
<p>üíæ <a href="https://swimburger.net/blog/dotnet/create-zip-files-on-http-request-without-intermediate-files-using-aspdotnet-mvc-razor-pages-and-endpoints">Create ZIP files on HTTP request without intermediate files using ASP.NET MVC, Razor Pages, and endpoints</a> The take away here is that using this technique you can create zip files without writing files to disk on your server.  Especially handy if you're into that <strike>cgi-bin</strike> serverless craze.</p>
<p>üéÅ <a href="https://github.com/JamesNK/Newtonsoft.Json/releases/tag/13.0.1">NewtonSoft.Json 13.0.1 has been released</a>.  New major version number, and it looks like the 'breaking change' is the default <code>MaxDepth</code>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Change - JsonReader and JsonSerializer MaxDepth defaults to 64</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There are a smattering of bug fixes along for the ride as well.</p>
<p>It was a light week in the world of .NET, and with Easter coming up in the states, you can expect this week to be light too.</p>
