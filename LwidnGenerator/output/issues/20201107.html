<p>📝 Not about .NET, but relevant to our interests: <a href="https://medium.com/pinterest-engineering/how-a-one-line-change-decreased-our-build-times-by-99-b98453265370">Pintrest Engineering talks about they decreased their build times by 99% by changing <em>one line</em> in their build process</a>.  If you use Git and you use Hosted CI, you're going to want to pay attention to this. Hell, even if you don't use Hosted CI, taking a look at what tricks may speed up your build time is <em>always</em> a good idea.  This post also re-inforces that good API naming is a must.  If you're a git expert, you probably know this trick, but for the rest of us, this stuff comes down to discoverability, and I'm not exaggerating when I say the git API is... opaque at best.</p>
<p>🎁 <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/HttpRepl/issues/360">You can now tell the HttpRepl where to find your OpenAPI files</a>.  If you use HttpRepl (Microsoft's command line version of cURL or Postman) you can now tell it where to find your swagger or other OpenAPI files.  This is one of those &quot;I really need to check out HttpRepl&quot; moments.  One of the problems with cURL and Postman have been the... well.. generic nature of the tool.  Having a tool that is aware of the modern web application stack is helpful. <a href="https://twitter.com/bradygaster/status/1323263446578728961">Special thanks to Brady Gaster on Twitter (&#64;bradygaster) for making me aware of this</a>.</p>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/state-of-net-webinar">Progress Telerik is hosting a &quot;The State of .NET&quot; Webinar</a>.  This is clearly a cash grab for your email address to so that they have you on their sales lists, but regardless, it should be informative.  Since I already have your email address, you can always wait for the <a href="https://podcast.lastweekin.net/">podcast episode</a> to drop where I cover everything that Microsoft released during .NET Conf.</p>
<p>📅 <a href="https://www.dotnetconf.net/">.NET Conf is November 10th - November 12th</a>. If you're listening to the podcast version of this, that means it's tomorrow.  I'll be live tweeting this from <a href="https://twitter.com/gortok">&#64;gortok on twitter</a> and I'll have a special wrapup afterwards on the podcast... like I just said above.</p>

Stay Frosty.</p>
<p>🐞 Not content to ruin everyone's day with the String.IndexOf linguistic comparison problems in .NET Core we talked about last week, <a href="https://twitter.com/jbogard/status/1324003632128397317?s=20">Jimmy Bogard found that a target framework moniker of NET50 and NET5.0 both work in Visual Studio</a>.  Both work due to Nuget parsing rules, and it's going to be interesting to see if this causes a problem come .NET 10.</p>
<p>🎥 <a href="https://www.telerik.com/campaigns/the-future-of-desktop-webinar">Progress Telerik also hosted a &quot;Future of Desktop&quot; webinar on .NET</a> last week, and while I missed the announcement before it happened, the video is available to watch. If you write .NET Desktop applications, check it out.</p>
<p>📝 <a href="https://daveabrock.com/2020/11/02/csharp-9-records-immutable-default">Are Records in C# 9 immutable by default</a>  Dave Brock asks this question and deep dives into the answer in his blog post: Short answer is, it depends, and somewhere a software architect is basking in the glow of that answer.</p>
<p>🎁 <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-1-rc/?WT.mc_id=DOP-MVP-4025064&amp;_lrsc=3c8e8640-0729-4ecc-b64a-4854c1c29eb2&amp;utm_campaign=elevate&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social">TypeScript 4.1 RC1 is now available</a> Because TypeScript doesn't support Semver, there are nearly always breaking changes in minor releases, and this one is no different. If you use TypeScript, it's healthy to be aware of these changes before they break your build because your package.json file wasn't pinned to the patch version for TypeScript.</p>
<p>And lastly,</p>
<p>🎁 <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues/19549#issuecomment-722567260">The EF Core folks aren't sleeping at all if this release changelog is any indication</a>.  EF Core 5.0 RC2 is out; and the list of changes is too long to mention here.  It's entirely evident that someone said &quot;Look, EF Core is coming on November 10th, so it'd better be ready&quot;.  If you know an EF Core team member, slide them a gift card and a socially distanced hug.</p>
