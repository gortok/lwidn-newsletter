<h3>Last Week in .NET - January 23rd, 2021</h3>
<p>Is it over yet?  Maybe?  Not sure.  2021 has certainly come in like a lion, here's hoping is goes out like a lamb.  A new president here in the states, a renewed focus on science, and a bunch of things happened last week in .NET.  Let's get to it.</p>
<h3>Releases</h3>
<p>📢<a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/releases/2019/release-notes-preview#16.9.0.pre.3.0">Visual Studio 16.9 Preview 3 has been released</a>  We now have intellisense for PREPROCESSOR symbols (yea, that was a written pun).  This is about 20 years overdue and I'm excited to see it. Not excited enough to actually <em>inflict</em> PREPROCESSOR symbols on anyone, mind you, but excited nonetheless.</p>
<p>📢<a href="https://github.com/dotnet/tye/releases/tag/release/0.6">Project Tye 0.6 is out</a> If you &quot;Microservices&quot; solely written in .NET, you should give Tye some attention.  It's 0.6, so give it the attention that versioning deserves.</p>
<p>📢<a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windowsdeveloper/2021/01/21/making-win32-apis-more-accessible-to-more-languages/">Microsoft has automated intellisense tooling to help you write P/Invoke... invocations</a>.

<p>📢<a href="https://github.com/reactiveui/refit/releases/tag/v6.0-preview.84">Refit v6.0-preview.84 has been released</a>, which is a type-safe rest API library for .NET.</p>
<p>📢<a href="https://github.com/borland/kdl-net">KDL Parser for .NET 1.0 has been released</a>  I didn't know about KDL Before now. Apparently it's like XML or JSON, it's a configuration language.  If you use it, shoot me a note. I'm interested to know more.</p>
