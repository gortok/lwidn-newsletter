<h2>Last Week in .NET - February 20th, 2021</h2>
<h3>.NET Releases</h3>
<p>üì¢ <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/announcing-net-6-preview-1/">.NET 6 Preview 1 is out</a>. Besides MAUI, there's a lot being packed into .NET 6, and what I'm looking forward to most are Single File Apps.  They were 'released' in .NET 5 for Linux only, and in .NET 6 they'll be available for Windows and MacOS as well.</p>
<p>üì¢ <a href="https://blog.dapr.io/posts/2021/02/17/announcing-dapr-v1.0/">Dapr 1.0 has been released</a>. Dapr allows you to hot-swap microservice features like queues, data stores, authorization schemes and secrets management.  It's a way to write Microservices for the least common denominator. it's like Kubernetes for Tech Stacks... and that's not a compliment.</p>
<h3>.NET News</h3>
<p>üìù <a href="https://kevinmontrose.com/2021/02/05/overthinking-csv-with-cesil-source-generators/">Do you need a high performing CSV parser in .NET?  Cesil has you covered</a> and it now supports source generators. Kevin is a really smart guy and he dives deep into how to use source generators for Cesil and what they do. Thanks, Kevin.</p>
<p>üé• <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iMVeJPCOb7I">Sam Basu joins the .NET Show to talk about MAUI</a>.  Not the island, the acryomn: Multi-platform App UI. If you want MAUI today, <a href="https://platform.uno/">try out UNO Platform</a>. Not a plug, just something that's already available... today.</p>
<p>üì¢ <a href="https://twitter.com/davidfowl/status/1361551121328738304?s=20">.NET 6 will have a priority queue, writes David Fowler</a>. I guess interviewers will have to find a new data structure for people to try to recreate.</p>
<p>‚òë <a href="https://dotnetfoundation.org/about/survey">The State of .NET Survey is going on right now</a>. It's built to give Microsoft a sense of why more people aren't using .NET, and if you are using .NET, what parts you're using.  It seems like Microsoft already has this information <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/telemetry">with their opt-out telemetry</a>, but it's your chance to tell them how you feel nonetheless.</p>
<p>üìò <a href="https://dotnet.microsoft.com/learn/aspnet/microservices-architecture#ebook-dapr-swimlane">The Introduction to Dapr for .NET Developers ebook has been released</a>.  Dapr stands for &quot;Distributed Application Runtime&quot;, and it's not to be confused with Dapper, the Micro-ORM from the folks at Stack Overflow.  Confusing, isn't it? Apparently people at Microsoft fell in love with the name and ignored complaints that it sounded like &quot;Dapr&quot;. Anyway, the book is out.</p>
<p>Who's the book for?  Well, that's the trickier part.  It's for people who want to create Microservices from scratch; which, you probably shouldn't do.</p>
<h3>Microsoft News</h3>
<p>üì∞ <a href="https://www.kunal-chowdhury.com/2021/02/windows-10-version-21h1-update-whcp.html">Windows 10 version 21h1 will arrive with no hardware certification changes</a>. The story never tells us why this is important, so let me hum a few bars: It means the hardware that has been certified to work on Windows 10 build 2004 will work for this version of Windows 10.</p>
<p>üì∞ <a href="https://msrc-blog.microsoft.com/2021/02/18/microsoft-internal-solorigate-investigation-final-update/">Microsoft released their <strong>final</strong> update for the Solorigate Investigation</a>.  For a &quot;final&quot; update, it leaves a lot to be desired information-wise; and there's a lot we still don't know.  These sorts of updates make it easy to think that there's more going on than is being reported.  I guess we'll see.</p>
<h3>Jobs</h3>
<p>üí∞ <a href="https://careers.microsoft.com/us/en/job/985457/Software-Engineer-II">Microsoft is looking for a Software Developer</a> for their One Engineering System team. This role looks to be geared towards ensuring the security of Microsoft's software supply chain.  <a href="https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-was-also-breached-in-recent-solarwinds-supply-chain-hack-report/">A bit of a coincidence given recent events</a>.</p>
