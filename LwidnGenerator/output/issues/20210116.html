<p>This is Last Week in .NET for the week that ended... well.. last week (January 16th, 2020). It was a rocky week last week; and more of the same expected this week for the Washington DC area, and with an inaguration and Martin Luther King day as our backdrop, let's dive into what happened last week in the world of .NET.</p>
<h3>Releases 📢</h3>
<p>📢 <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0.2/5.0.2.md">.NET 5.0.2 has been released</a>.  This release fixes <a href="https://msrc.microsoft.com/update-guide/vulnerability/CVE-2021-1723">CVE-2021-1723 | ASP.NET Core Denial of Service Vulnerability</a> attack. If you run .NET Core on Kestrel, you're vulnerable to this attack, so update immediately. There are several bug fixes for <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/aspnetcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved">ASP.NET Core</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved">.NET runtime</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/efcore/issues?q=milestone%3A5.0.2+is%3Aclosed+label%3Aservicing-approved">Entity Framework Core 5</a> included as well.</p>
<p>📢 In the same vein, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/3.1/3.1.11/3.1.11.md">.NET Core 3.1.11 has been released</a> with the same CVE 2021-1723 fix, as well as some backported fixes from .NET 5.0.2 and other fixes specific to .NET Core 3.1.</p>
<p>📢 Not to be left out, <a href="https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/2.1/2.1.24/2.1.24.md">.NET Core 2.1.24 has also been released</a> and at this point you can probably guess what I'm going to say: They fixed the aforementioned CVE vulnerability, as well as several backported bug fixes and bug fixes specific to .NET Core 2.1.</p>
<p>☠ <a href="https://devblogs.microsoft.com/dotnet/net-january-2021/">Speaking of .NET Core 2.1: Its End of Life is August 21, 2021</a>  As stated in the blog post,</p>
<blockquote>
<p>After that time, .NET Core 2.1 patch updates will no longer be provided. We recommend that you move any .NET Core 2.1 applications and environments to .NET Core 3.1 in first half of 2021. It’ll be an easy upgrade in most cases.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Parenthetically, of course, I hope your upgrades go better than mine usually do. I seem to hit every upgrade problem that could exist.</p>
<p>📢 <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/windows-insider/2021/01/12/releasing-windows-10-build-19042-746-20h2-to-beta-and-release-preview-channels/">Windows 10 version 20H2 Build 19042.746 has been released to the beta channels</a> and these are chock full of security fixes that probably don't matter to you and I, but matter greatly to enterprises.</p>
<p>📢 <a href="https://blog.duendesoftware.com/posts/20210114_v5_release/">IdentityServer 5 has been released</a> This is the first major release under the new company's banner, and here's to many more.</p>
<p>🍾 <a href="https://www.nanoframework.net/?utm_content=151278532&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;hss_channel=tw-2384354214">You can now write C# for embedded systems using NanoFramework</a> THIS IS INCREDIBLE.  I used C when writing the firmware for Jewelbots (Because let's be honest there were no alternatives), and I'm excited to see that .NET is now a viable option. Part of me wants to take a few weeks and rewrite the firmware in Nanoframework, just to see if it's possible, but the other part of me knows it'll have to take a <a href="https://www.doubleyourproductivity.io">backseat to my TDD courses and classes</a>. I will add it to the list, however.</p>

<p>😲<a href="https://twitter.com/venikunche/status/1348607851556712448?s=20">The Parler 'hack' is a masterclass in bad ideas having bad outcomes</a> If you haven't kept up: Parler relied on several external services for security; but when those services were yanked away (due to Parler hosting neo-nazi and insurrectionist content), their code took the absence of such services as a reason to <em>approve</em> whatever action the user was trying to take.  It's the equivalent of your house security system letting everyone in if the phone-line goes down.  There's so much more to the Parler hack, from the lack of rate-limiting to the ability for people to pull down 60-70TBs of information from Parler's AWS hosted storage, which --- to add insult to injury, results in a massive egress bill from AWS to Parler, on top of AWS no longer hosting Parler.</p>

<p>🤦‍♂️<a href="https://twitter.com/businessinsider/status/1349066876324896773">Github fired and then re-hired the person who made an internal team chat that said &quot;Nazis are about&quot; in the Capitol Insurrection</a> This disgusted me when it happened: A Jewish github employee was <em>fired</em> for warning the company about literal nazis.  The head of HR later fell on their sword for this egregious failure of leadership by the company, and it reinforces my question: Where the hell is the adult leadership at Github? Between the ICE contract and this, I'm not sure they realize what political sphere their company inhabits.</p>
