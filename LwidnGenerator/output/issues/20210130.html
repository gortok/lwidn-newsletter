<h2>Last Week in .NET - January 30th, 2021</h2>
<p>We're getting our first snow here in the DC area for the first time in what feels like forever; and the .NET team is pondering the true meaning of the words &quot;Backlog management&quot;. Let's get to it.</p>
<p>🌎 As previously alluded to, the <a href="https://twitter.com/evntdrvn/status/1353718869374988289?s=20">.NET team is closing older issues in their Github repos</a>, and this is a cause for alarm among the folks that write these issues. If you run an open source project, sooner or later you're going to run into this if you don't have the people-power to manage your backlog.  I hope the .NET team takes the time to realize this hints at a much deeper problem, and that problem <em>isn't</em> &quot;too many issues are opened on Github&quot;.</p>
<p>📝 <a href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2021/01/25/a-deeper-dive-into-our-may-2019-security-incident/">Stack Overflow deep dives into their May <strong>2019</strong> security incident</a>. The word 'incident' has the same energy that my two-year old does when she has a poopy pull-up and decides she'd rather not wear it any more.   That aside, this is a fascinating look into what actually happened, and how Stack Overflow used what the attacker searched Stack Overflow for to figure out where they were going to hit next.  Using Stack Overflow to hack Stack Overflow is a new one on me.</p>
<p>🤼 <a href="https://focus.dotnetconf.net/">.NET Conf Focus on Windows Desktop Development is February 25th, 2021</a>. No speakers, no schedule, just a save the date.  Cutting it kinda close, aren't we, .NET?</p>

<p>🌎 <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream/pull/129">Ben Watson wants your input on <em>breaking</em> changes being made to Microsoft.IO.RecyclableMemoryStream</a> It's like database connection pooling, but for the large object heap.</p>
<p>📢 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/lambda-the-ultimatae-excel-worksheet-function/">Microsoft has released LAMBDA for Excel</a> You would be wrong if you thought that the word LAMBDA was an acronym  for something.  Rather, it's because the keyboard got stuck and Marketing thought that was edgy. Now that Excel is turing complete, I await Doom being created in Excel.</p>

<p>And that's it for what happened last week in .NET. I'm George Stocker, and I'm hosting a free webinar on TDD in .NET on March 5th. When I'm not doing that, I'm helping .NET teams double their productivity through Test Driven Development.

<p>Thanks, and I'll see you next week.</p>
