<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1309251778823692288">Nat Friedman, CEO of Github, unfollows everyone in an attempt to hear less about Github putting children in cages</a>.</h3>
<p>On September 24th, Nat tweeted &quot;Github Stories ðŸ¤”&quot; and his replies filled up with references to ICE putting kids in cages.</p>
<p>If you remember, Github has a contract with ICE, and come hell, highwater, or angry public sentiment, is going to continue to honor that contract. Maybe Nat doesn't want hearing about that in his feed any more <a href="https://twitter.com/natfriedman/status/1307412289620865026?s=20">and so he unfollowed everyone</a>.</p>

<h3><a href="https://twitter.com/gylkag/status/1310524861656313857?s=20">Linux won't get any love in MAUI</a></h3>
<p>MAUI is 'multi-platform', not 'cross-platform'.  While this may seem like tomato and tomato, there are a few people out there who are mad that MAUI won't support... the linux desktop.  Presumably the same number of people liked the ending of LOST.</p>
<p>If you are looking for 'true' cross-platform Desktop UI frameworks; give <a href="https://avaloniaui.net/">AvaloniaUI</a> a try or give in and use electron like everyone else.</p>

<p>The .NET Foundation is hosting the aforementioned meetup about Microservices and containerization tomorrow (September 29th) at 4pm UTC.</p>
<p>Remember: If someone touts microservices without diving into discussing communication among containers (past HTTP Request/Response), event-driven architecture, under what conditions your org structure would benefit from microservices, or whether or not your workload needs that sort of separation, run quickly.</p>
